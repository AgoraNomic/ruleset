------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regulation BT14/0

      At the start of the game, each Great Power controls three supply
      centers, with the exception of Russia, which controls four. These
      are allocated according to the table shown in the official rules.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regulation BT15/0
Birthday Tournament 15

      At the beginning of each turn, there is a period, lasting from
      0:00 UTC until 24:00 UTC on the same calendar day, in which
      negotiations should occur. Following this, there is a period until
      12:00 UTC on the following day, during which orders CAN be
      submitted privately to the Gamemaster. The next turn will begin at
      24:00 UTC on that day, by which time the Gamemaster SHALL have
      resolved the orders, according to the regulations as they were at
      the end of the ordering period and announced the new state of the
      game. Orders CAN be submitted during the negotiations period and
      can be changed at any time when orders could be submitted. Each
      set of orders should specify what eir units will do and how they
      will retreat and disband if necessary. When appropriate, orders
      should also contain conditionals for the creation and destruction
      of units. Orders should specify unit type, one or more provinces,
      and an action.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regulation BT16/0
Birthday Tournament 16

      Each turn represents six months of time. The first turn is called
      a Spring turn and the next a Fall turn. After each Fall turn, each
      Great Power must reconcile the number of units it controls with
      the number of supply centers it controls. At this time some units
      are removed and new ones are built, as specified in these
      regulations. After a Fall turn, if one Great Power controls 18 or
      more supply centers, all other Contestants cease to be
      Contestants.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regulation BT17/0
Birthday Tournament 17

      There are four possible orders: Hold, Move, Support, and Convoy.
      Not giving a unit an order is interpreted as ordering it to hold.
      A Hold order orders a unit to stay where it is. A Move order
      orders a unit to move to a different province. Armies can only
      move onto adjacent inland or coastal provinces. Fleets can only
      move to adjacent water or coastal provinces. A Move order making
      use of a Convoy must specify what Convoy paths it will use or
      conditionals to determine such. Support orders help another unit's
      action, whether or not it is a unit of the same Great Power. An
      Army or Fleet can provide support to another Army or Fleet.
      Support can be offensive or defensive. A Convoy order orders a
      fleet in a water province to move an army from an adjacent coastal
      province to another adjacent coastal province.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regulation BT18/0
Birthday Tournament 18

      Bulgaria, Spain, and St. Petersburg have separately identified
      coasts, between which fleets cannot move. If Fleets occupy
      adjacent water provinces, an Army can be convoyed through all
      these water provinces on one turn, landing in a coastal province
      adjacent to the final Fleet in the chain.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regulation BT19/0
Birthday Tournament 19

      If two units of equal strength or which are equally supported are
      trying to occupy the same province, all remain where they began.
      If two or more equally supported units are ordered to the same
      province, none of them can move. If two units are each ordered to
      the province that the other occupies, neither can move. If a move
      is successful, the attacking unit moves into the province to which
      it was ordered. If the unit that was attacked had no orders of its
      own to move elsewhere, it’s defeated and dislodged from the
      province. The dislodged unit must retreat or be disbanded.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regulation BT20/0
Birthday Tournament 20

      A unit moves with its own strength combined with all of its valid
      supports. Support is cut if the unit giving support is attacked
      from any province except the one where support is being given or
      if the unit giving support is dislodged.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regulation BT21/0
Birthday Tournament 21

      A country can’t dislodge or support the dislodgment of one of its
      own units, even if that dislodgment is unexpected. An attack by a
      country on one of its own units doesn’t cut support. A convoyed
      Army doesn’t cut the support of a unit supporting an attack
      against one of the Fleets necessary for the Army to convoy.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regulation BT22/0
Birthday Tournament 22

      A dislodged unit must retreat to an adjacent province. Retreats
      can’t be convoyed or supported. If two or more units are ordered
      to retreat to the same province, they all must be disbanded. If a
      player fails to order a retreat when necessary, the unit is
      disbanded.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regulation BT23/0
Birthday Tournament 23

      A country controls a supply center when one of its units occupies
      that supply-center province after a Fall turn has been played and
      completed. Once a country gains control of a supply center, it can
      leave the center vacant and still keep control of it, as long as
      that center isn’t occupied by another country at the close of a
      Fall turn. As part of eir Fall orders, each player adjusts the
      number of units it had to match the number of supply centers it
      controls. If a country has fewer supply centers than units, it
      must disband the excess number of units.  If a country has more
      supply centers than units, it can place new units in each
      unoccupied supply center of its home country that it still
      controls. All provinces can build armies, but only coastal
      provinces can build fleets.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regulation BT24/0
Birthday Tournament 24

      If a player leaves the game or otherwise fail to submit orders on
      a given Spring or Fall turn, the Gamemaster SHALL attempt to replace
      em with a new Contestant, but if this fails, it's assumed that eir
      government has collapsed. Eir units all hold in position, but
      don’t support each other. If they’re dislodged, they’re disbanded.
      No new units are raised for the country. If a country in civil
      disorder has to remove units, the units farthest from the country
      are removed first. If units are equally distant, then remove
      Fleets before Armies and then in alphabetical order by the
      provinces in which they’re located.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regulation BT25/0
Birthday Tournament 25

      Where these regulations are silent, the Gamemaster CAN make use of
      the official rules or eir own common sense to ensure smooth play.
