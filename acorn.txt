Auction Regulations
   This section has the regulations, written by the Treasuror, governing
   how auctions proceed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regulation AM0/4
Generalized Auction

      Generalized auctions exist to give context to the form of other
      types of auctions. They CANNOT be held directly. Other auction
      methods that use this type of auction as a starting point can
      override attributes of generalized auctions except when it is
      explicitly stated that that attribute is not able to be
      overridden.
      
      INITIATION: When a person CAN begin an auction by this or any
      derivative method, e CAN only do so by specifying the type of
      auction method to be held, a list of lots to be auctioned off, and
      the currency for the auction in a public message (henceforth the
      "initiation message"). The bidding period starts at this point.
      
      BIDDING: Players CAN place a bid on an auction in its bidding
      period by creating a public message (henceforth a "bid message")
      specifying an amount of that auction's currency. Players CAN
      withdraw from an open auction by announcement.
      
      EXCLUSIVITY: Bids in an auction are grouped into classes of that
      auction. Unless otherwise specified, all bids in a given auction
      are in a single class. A bid CANNOT be made if, in the class it
      would be in, another bid already exists with the bid amount of the
      hypothetical bid.
      
      TERMINATION: The bidding period ends four days after the final
      instance of any of the following events' occurance:
        * the auction begins
        * a bid is placed
        * a player withdraws from the auction
      
      RETRIEVAL: When the bidding period ends, the retrieval period
      begins. During the retrieval period, bidders will be allowed to
      retrieve the assets required to pay for their bid. The retrieval
      period lasts three days. Failing to have the requisite assets when
      the retrieval period for an auction ends constitutes the Class 1
      Crime of Underfundedness.
      
      AWARDING: For each auction, there are a number of awardees equal
      to the number of lots. The Nth lot of an auction goes to the Nth
      awardee of that auction. If the identity of an awardee is
      undecidable, then that lot cannot be given away. Auction methods
      specify how awardees are picked for auctions using that method.
      
      PAYMENT AMOUNT: The amount that an awardee in an auction is
      required to pay for eir lot is, unless otherwise specified, the
      amount of the auction's curency specified in eir highest bid on
      that auction.
      
      FUNDED PLAYERS: Derivative auction methods should ensure that only
      players who, at the end of an auction's retrieval period, have at
      least as much of that auction's currency as the amount that e is
      required to pay in that auction (hereafter "funded players") can
      be selected as awardees for auctions using that auction method.
      
      RESOLUTION: The auctioneer for an auction SHALL, during that
      auction's retrieval period, create a public message (henceforth
      the "resolution message") that contains a full history of bids on
      the auction and withdrawals from the auction. It must also clearly
      indicate who each awardee would be if all players were funded, as
      well as the lot each one would recieve. Failing to publish a
      resolution message constitutes the Class 3 Crime of Auction
      Negligence.
      
      DISTRIBUTION: In a timely fashion after the retrieval period for
      an auction ends, that auction's auctioneer CAN and SHALL, for each
      awardee in that auction, destroy the amount to be paid from the
      inventory of that awardee and transfer to that player (or create
      in eir possession if the item is new) the set of assets associated
      with the lot e won. Failing to create or transfer items as
      described in this paragraph constitutes the Class 3 Crime of
      Auction Abandonment.
      
      ACTIVE BIDS: The set of active bids for an auction is the set of
      all funded, non-withdrawn players' highest bids on that auction.

Regulation AM2/1
Sealed-bid Auctions

      Sealed-bid auctions function like generalized auctions except:
      
      * Players can only submit bids on a sealed-bid auction if they do
        not have a bid in that auction.
      * Bids must be initially hidden so that it is impossible to tell
        its value but that it is verifiable that the amount bid was
        decided before the bid was placed. Anything that claims to be a
        bid and fits these conditions is considered a bid.
      * The retrieval period for a sealed-bid auction lasts for seven
        days.
      * Each player SHALL reveal eir bid amount on a sealed-bid auction
        while the auction is in its retrieval period. Failing to do so
        is the Class 2 Crime of Potential Faking.
      * The termination message need not indicate any bids for which the
        amount bid is not known.
      * The Nth awardee of a sealed-bid auction is the player whose bid
        is the Nth-highest active bid on that auction.

Second-price Auctions

      Second-price auctions function like forward auctions except:
      
      * The amount to be paid by the Nth awardee is the amount of the
        auction's currency specified by the (N-1)th highest active bid
        on that auction or the lowest active bid if such a value does
        not exist.

Nonwinning-price Auctions

      Nonwinning-price auctions function like forward auctions except:
      
      * The amount to by paid by all awardees is the amount of the
        auction's currency specified by the highest active bid on that
        auction not placed by an awardee or the lowest active bid if
        such a value does not exist.

Regulation AM5/3
Selective-bid Auctions

      Selective-bit auctions function like generalized auctions except:
      
      * Bidding messages on a selective-bid auction must also specify a
        lot that is preferred.
      * One bid class exists for each lot of a given auction, with bids
        falling into the class for the specified lot.
      * The Nth awardee of a selective-bid auction is the player who
        placed the highest bid in the set of bids made by funded, non
        withdrawn players whose preferred bid is the Nth lot.

Administrative Regulations
   This section has regulations enacted by officers, pursuant to Rule
   2630.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regulation PA0/0
Certification

      For the Promotor to cause a proposal to become pending with 2+N
      support, where N is equal to the number of times e has done so in
      the past 7 days, is for em to certify it.
      
      A proposal is certifiable if:
      1. it is reasonably narrowly tailored to fix one or more problems,
         including a) bugs, b) errors, c) ambiguities, and d)
         vulnerabilities*; or
      2. unusual or exigent circumstance render it in the public
         interest for it to become pending via this method.
      
      * Note: Any of these problems may arise from a single source or
        the interaction of multiple sources, which may be individually
        unproblematic. This provision is to be interpreted broadly and
        flexibly to effectuate its spirit.
      
      The Promotor SHOULD NOT certify a non-certifiable proposal.
      Players SHOULD support an intent to certify a proposal if and only
      if it is certifiable.
      
      The author of a proposal in the pool CAN, by announcement, request
      certification of the proposal, provided e does so in a message
      that has either "Promotor" or "Proposal" in the subject line; e
      SHOULD NOT do so unless e believes eir proposal is certifiable and
      is ENCOURAGED to explain why eir proposal is certifiable. Once
      certification is requested, the Promotor SHALL respond publicly
      before publishing the next report that contains the proposal,
      unless the proposal is withdrawn or pended in the interim.
      Petitioning the Promotor to certify a proposal is DEPRECATED.

Regulation PA1/0
Proposal Style Guide

      Players SHOULD format proposals in accordance with the following
      guidelines.  These guidelines represent the Promotor's preferred
      formatting. Most of these guidelines are flexible recommendations,
      but where something is marked as STRONGLY DISCOURAGED, doing it is
      actively inconvenient for the Promotor.
      
      I. Headers and Metadata.
      
      1. Format headers as close as possible to the heading used for
         distributions, which looks like this:
      
      Title: _____
      Adoption index: _._
      Author: ____
      Co-authors: ____, ____
      
      To be clear:
      a) write the fields in that order;
      b) write out all the fields, even the ones that have default
         values; and
      c) write each field on its own line.
      
      2. a) Give proposals titles 35 characters or less.
         b) Giving proposals titles over 70 characters is STRONGLY
            DISCOURAGED.  
      
      II. Bodies.
      
      1. Indent Proposals two spaces per indent level.
      
      2. a) Wrap proposal lines to 80 characters or less.
         b) Making it so the Promotor cannot wrap lines to 80 characters
            or less is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED unless it is absolutely
            unavoidable (e.g.  in the case of URLs).
      
      3. Players are STRONGLY DISCOURAGED from placing markings that
         indicate the start of the proposal's text on the same line as
         the start of the text.

Regulation RA1/1
Tardiness

      The Referee SHALL NOT impose a fine above one blot for Tardiness
      unless the Tardiness is for an obligation which has been missed

Regulation RA2/0
Guidelines to Referees for Compiling Weekly Reports

      Courtesy of the illustrious Publius Scribonius Scholasticus, when
      making eir weekly report on blot holdings, a Referee is ENCOURAGED
      to additionally include:
      
      1. A section tracking investigations resulting from a finger being
      pointed of which the Referee is the investigator, which have not
      been concluded at the time of the report’s publishing; e SHOULD
      provide the following fields for each entry:
      
          a. Name of the perp
          b. Name of the person who pointed eir finger
          d. Summary of the available findings at the time of the report
      
      The Referee is strongly DISCOURAGED from reporting on
      investigations of which e is not the investigator. At the time of
      the promulgation of this regulation, the only rule-defined
      circumstance in which the Referee is not the investigator is when
      the Referee is the perp. As such, eir reports on such
      investigations may be misleading and are at a high likelihood of
      violating rule 2471.
      
      2. A section tracking historical changes to the blots possessed by
      persons. If available, the time period tracked is RECOMMENDED to
      begin from approximately two years prior and end at the time of
      the report’s publishing. E SHOULD provide the following columns
      for this section:
      
          a. Name of person in whose possession the number of blots has
             changed
          b. Change in number of blots
          c. Date of change
          d. Reason of change

Holiday Rule Reminder Practice

      In addition to the recommendations contained within rule 1769, the
      Referee is strongly ENCOURAGED to remind the players of the end of
      the Holiday by announcement. This SHOULD be done between 2 to 4
      days before the end of the Holiday.

Regulation BT29/0
Survivor 2021

      #0 Participation
      
      The Host is the Herald. Any other player of Agora CAN become a
      Contestant by announcement any time before the game starts. If the
      Host is a Contestant, Player, and/or Ghost, e ceases to be.
      
      The Host CAN start the game by announcement. At the time of the
      announcement, all Contestants become Survivors.
      
      Any Contestant may quit by announcement, and cease being a
      Contestant, Survivor, and/or Ghost. The Host CAN, by announcement,
      cause a specified Contestant who has not posted a public message
      in 7 days to cease to be a Survivor and become a Ghost.
      
      #1 Winning
      
      The winner is the Contestant who Outlasts all other Contestants. A
      Contestant outlasts all other Contestants if e is the only
      Survivor.
      
      #2 Teams
      
      When the game starts, the host SHALL announce the teams. E may
      choose teams however e wants, as long as they are even in number
      of contestants (plus or minus 1).
      
      #3 Rounds
      
      A Round is 7 days from a Monday through a Sunday. Monday through
      Friday are the default Competition Period for a Round while
      Saturday through Sunday are the default Voting Period for a Round.
      The Host CAN, by announcement, end a Competition Period and start
      a Voting period early.  E SHOULD only do so when the Competition
      Period's events have clearly ended.
      
      The first round begins the next Monday after the game starts.
      Until the Pre-Finale, a new round starts every Monday.
      
      #3.1 Competitions
      
      Each round contains a Competition defined by a Sealed Letter that
      the Host CAN and SHALL issue, by announcement, on or before the
      Monday of the round. The Competition begins either at the
      beginning of Monday or when the Sealed Letter is issued, whichever
      is later.
      
      A Sealed Letter specifies a Competition's rules and Immunity
      Condition.  The Immunity Condition of a Sealed Letter:
      
      * SHOULD NOT encourage players to break the rules of Agora or
      commit an Agoran Crime,
      
      * SHOULD NOT require undo effort on the part of any one
      individual, and
      
      * SHOULD NOT intentionally favor one person or team.
      
      The Host CAN, by announcement, and SHALL grant immunity to all
      teams and all Contestant that meet the Immunity Condition.
      
      The Host CAN issue a Clarifying Letter by announcement. Clarifying
      Letters are binding interpretations of their corresponding Sealed
      Letters. The Host SHOULD issue a Clarifying Letter whenever e
      believes players/teams are confused, frustrated, or on the wrong
      track.
      
      #3.2 Voting
      
      During a Voting Period, each Contestant whose team is not immune
      CAN, by sending a message to the Host, Vote to Expel any
      non-immune member of eir team.
      
      The Host CAN, by announcement, and SHALL, by the end of the
      following Monday, Expel all non-immune Contestants who were
      specified the most by eir team. When a Contestant is Expelled, e
      ceases to be a Survivor and becomes a Ghost. E is no longer part
      of eir team.
      
      #Plot Holes
      
      The Host CAN, with Agoran Consent, amend these rules as specified.
      E SHOULD only attempt to do so to fix unintended behavior or bugs.
      
      #Pre-Finale
      
      When there are half as many Survivors as they were when the game
      started, the Host CAN, by announcement, cause the game to enter
      the Pre-Finale.
      
      During the Pre-Finale, the current round, if any, immediately ends
      and no new rounds can begin.
      
      During the Pre-Finale, the Host and any Survivor CAN publish a
      Finale Script, specifying a set of changes to make to the rules of
      this game.  Contestants CAN, by announcement, support a Finale
      Script. The Host CAN, by announcement, veto a specified Finale
      Script. If a Finale Script has not been veto'd, and has support of
      either more than half of all Ghosts or more than half of all
      Contestants, then the Host CAN and SHALL apply it, causing the
      changes it describes to happen to these rules.
      
      If at least one Finale Script has been applied and it has been at
      least 7 days since the Pre-Finale began, the Host CAN by
      announcement begin the Finale.
      
      #Finale
      
      During the Finale, all Contestants CAN, by sending a message to
      the Host, vote on a specified Survivor. When all Contestants have
      voted, or 7 days after the Finale began, the Host CAN announce the
      Survivor who received the most votes, and Expel all other
      Survivors.
