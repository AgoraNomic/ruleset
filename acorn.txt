========================================================================
Auction Regulations
   This section has the regulations, written by the Treasuror, governing
   how auctions proceed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regulation AM0/2
Generalized Auction

      Generalized auctions exist to give context to the form of other
      types of auctions. They CANNOT be held directly. Other auction
      methods that use this type of auction as a starting point can
      override attributes of generalized auctions except when it is
      explicitly stated that that attribute is not able to be
      overridden.
      
      INITIATION: When a person CAN begin an auction by this or any
      derivative method, e CAN only do so by specifying the type of
      auction method to be held, a list of lots to be auctioned off, and
      the currency for the auction in a public message (henceforth the
      "initiation message"). The bidding period starts at this point.
      
      BIDDING: Players CAN place a bid on an auction in its bidding
      period by creating a public message (henceforth a "bid message")
      specifying a number of the auction's currency as eir bid not equal
      to the bid of another player. Players CAN withdraw from an open
      auction by announcement.
      
      TERMINATION: The bidding period ends four days after the final
      instance of any of the following events' occurance:
        * the auction begins
        * a bid is placed
        * a player withdraws from the auction
      
      RETRIEVAL: When the bidding period ends, the retrieval period
      begins. During the retrieval period, bidders will be allowed to
      retrieve the assets required to pay for their bid. The retrieval
      period lasts three days. Failing to have the requisite assets when
      the retrieval period for an auction ends constitutes the Class 1
      Crime of Underfundedness.
      
      AWARDING: For each auction, there are a number of awardees equal
      to the number of lots. The Nth lot of an auction goes to the Nth
      awardee of that auction. If the identity of an awardee is
      undecidable, then that lot cannot be given away. Auction methods
      specify how awardees are picked for auctions using that method.
      
      PAYMENT AMOUNT: The amount that an awardee in an auction is
      required to pay for eir lot is, unless otherwise specified, the
      amount of the auction's curency specified in eir highest bid on
      that auction.
      
      FUNDED PLAYERS: Derivative auction methods should ensure that only
      players who, at the end of an auction's retrieval period, have at
      least as much of that auction's currency as the amount that e is
      required to pay in that auction (hereafter "funded players") can
      be selected as awardees for auctions using that auction method.
      
      DISTRIBUTION: The auctioneer for an auction CAN and SHALL, within
      seven days of the ending of that auction's retrieval period,
      create a public message (henceforth the "distribution message")
      that contains a full history of bids on the auction and
      withdrawals from the auction. It must also clearly indicate each
      awardee and the lot e recieves. In this message, the auctioneer
      CAN and SHALL destroy the amount to be paid from the inventory
      each awardee and transfer to that player (or create in eir
      possession if the item is new) the set of assets associated with
      the lot e won. Failing to publish a distribution message
      constitutes the Class 3 Crime of Auction Abandonment.
      
      ACTIVE BIDS: The set of active bids for an auction is the set of
      all funded, non-withdrawn players' highest bids on that auction.

Regulation AM1/1
Forward Auctions

Regulation AM2/1
Sealed-bid Auctions

      Sealed-bid auctions function like generalized auctions except:
      
      * Players can only submit bids on a sealed-bid auction if they do
        not have a bid in that auction.
      * Bids must be initially hidden so that it is impossible to tell
        its value but that it is verifiable that the amount bid was
        decided before the bid was placed. Anything that claims to be a
        bid and fits these conditions is considered a bid.
      * The retrieval period for a sealed-bid auction lasts for seven
        days.
      * Each player SHALL reveal eir bid amount on a sealed-bid auction
        while the auction is in its retrieval period. Failing to do so
        is the Class 2 Crime of Potential Faking.
      * The termination message need not indicate any bids for which the
        amount bid is not known.
      * The Nth awardee of a sealed-bid auction is the player whose bid
        is the Nth-highest active bid on that auction.

Regulation AM3/1
Second-price Auctions

      Second-price auctions function like forward auctions except:
      
      * The amount to be paid by the Nth awardee is the amount of the
        auction's currency specified by the (N-1)th highest active bid
        on that auction or the lowest active bid if such a value does
        not exist.

Regulation AM4/1
Nonwinning-price Auctions

      Nonwinning-price auctions function like forward auctions except:
      
      * The amount to by paid by all awardees is the amount of the
        auction's currency specified by the highest active bid on that
        auction not placed by an awardee or the lowest active bid if
        such a value does not exist.

Regulation AM5/1
Selective-bid Auctions

      Selective-bit auctions function like generalized auctions except:
      
      * Bidding messages on a selective-bid auction must also specify a
        lot that is preferred.
      * The Nth awardee of a selective-bid auction is the player who
        placed the highest active bid whose preferred bid is the Nth
        lot.

Administrative Regulations
   This section has regulations enacted by officers, pursuant to Rule
   2630.

Regulation PA0/0
Certification

      For the Promotor to cause a proposal to become pending with 2+N
      support, where N is equal to the number of times e has done so in
      the past 7 days, is for em to certify it.
      
      A proposal is certifiable if:
      1. it is reasonably narrowly tailored to fix one or more problems,
         including a) bugs, b) errors, c) ambiguities, and d)
         vulnerabilities*; or
      2. unusual or exigent circumstance render it in the public
         interest for it to become pending via this method.
      
      * Note: Any of these problems may arise from a single source or
        the interaction of multiple sources, which may be individually
        unproblematic. This provision is to be interpreted broadly and
        flexibly to effectuate its spirit.
      
      The Promotor SHOULD NOT certify a non-certifiable proposal.
      Players SHOULD support an intent to certify a proposal if and only
      if it is certifiable.
      
      The author of a proposal in the pool CAN, by announcement, request
      certification of the proposal, provided e does so in a message
      that has either "Promotor" or "Proposal" in the subject line; e
      SHOULD NOT do so unless e believes eir proposal is certifiable and
      is ENCOURAGED to explain why eir proposal is certifiable. Once
      certification is requested, the Promotor SHALL respond publicly
      before publishing the next report that contains the proposal,
      unless the proposal is withdrawn or pended in the interim.
      Petitioning the Promotor to certify a proposal is DEPRECATED.

Regulation PA1/0
Proposal Style Guide

      Players SHOULD format proposals in accordance with the following
      guidelines.  These guidelines represent the Promotor's preferred
      formatting. Most of these guidelines are flexible recommendations,
      but where something is marked as STRONGLY DISCOURAGED, doing it is
      actively inconvenient for the Promotor.
      
      I. Headers and Metadata.
      
      1. Format headers as close as possible to the heading used for
         distributions, which looks like this:
      
      Title: _____
      Adoption index: _._
      Author: ____
      Co-authors: ____, ____
      
      To be clear:
      a) write the fields in that order;
      b) write out all the fields, even the ones that have default
         values; and
      c) write each field on its own line.
      
      2. a) Give proposals titles 35 characters or less.
         b) Giving proposals titles over 70 characters is STRONGLY
            DISCOURAGED.  
      
      II. Bodies.
      
      1. Indent Proposals two spaces per indent level.
      
      2. a) Wrap proposal lines to 80 characters or less.
         b) Making it so the Promotor cannot wrap lines to 80 characters
            or less is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED unless it is absolutely
            unavoidable (e.g.  in the case of URLs).
      
      3. Players are STRONGLY DISCOURAGED from placing markings that
         indicate the start of the proposal's text on the same line as
         the start of the text.

Regulation RA0/0
Limitations to Powers of Interim Referees

      An interim holder of the office of Referee (henceforth known as an
      ‘Interim Referee’) SHALL NOT impose summary judgement more than
      twice a week.
      
      It is PROHIBITED for an Interim Referee levy a fine to a person
      who commits the Class 2 Crime of Tardiness, if the person's
      deadline to perform eir duty occurs during a Holiday, as defined
      by rule 1769.
      
      A Referee MUST NOT enact or amend any other regulations in such a
      manner as to cause any of them to take precedence over this
      regulation.
      
      This regulation takes precedence over all other administrative
      regulations promulgated by any Referee.

Regulation RA1/0
General Enforcement Policies

      If a Referee wishes to impose the Cold Hand of Justice on any perp
      for the Class 2 Crime of Tardiness, e is strongly RECOMMENDED to
      specify the violation as forgivable, unless the perp has
      consecutively committed the violation or the evidence indicates
      that the perp has used or has attempted to use the violation as
      part of a plan to abuse eir official position.
      
      Referees are ENCOURAGED to amend this regulation to specify best
      practices for other crimes and violations.

Regulation RA2/0
Guidelines to Referees for Compiling Weekly Reports

      Courtesy of the illustrious Publius Scribonius Scholasticus, when
      making eir weekly report on blot holdings, a Referee is ENCOURAGED
      to additionally include:
      
      1. A section tracking investigations resulting from a finger being
      pointed of which the Referee is the investigator, which have not
      been concluded at the time of the report’s publishing; e SHOULD
      provide the following fields for each entry:
      
          a. Name of the perp
          b. Name of the person who pointed eir finger
          d. Summary of the available findings at the time of the report
      
      The Referee is strongly DISCOURAGED from reporting on
      investigations of which e is not the investigator. At the time of
      the promulgation of this regulation, the only rule-defined
      circumstance in which the Referee is not the investigator is when
      the Referee is the perp. As such, eir reports on such
      investigations may be misleading and are at a high likelihood of
      violating rule 2471.
      
      2. A section tracking historical changes to the blots possessed by
      persons. If available, the time period tracked is RECOMMENDED to
      begin from approximately two years prior and end at the time of
      the report’s publishing. E SHOULD provide the following columns
      for this section:
      
          a. Name of person in whose possession the number of blots has
             changed
          b. Change in number of blots
          c. Date of change
          d. Reason of change

Regulation RA3/0
Holiday Rule Reminder Practice

      In addition to the recommendations contained within rule 1769, the
      Referee is strongly ENCOURAGED to remind the players of the end of
      the Holiday by announcement. This SHOULD be done between 2 to 4
      days before the end of the Holiday.
