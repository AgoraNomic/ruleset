Regulation BT31/0
HIGHEST NUMBER GAME

      Any player CAN become a party to this tournament by announcement.
      
      7 days after this regulation is promulgated, Game Night starts.
      
      Tokens are a fungible fixed asset. The pot is an entity that can
      own tokens.
      
      When Game Night starts, each party is granted 12 tokens.
      
      Immediately after the start of each week, if bidding did not begin
      the previous week, bidding begins. Otherwise, revealing begins.
      
      During a week in which bidding began:
      
      * Each party CAN, by announcement, transfer tokens they own to the
        pot.
      
      * Each party CAN once per week, by commitment, declare a secret
        number (a text document containing a clear description of a
        natural number).
      
      During a week in which revealing began:
      
      * Each party CAN, by announcement, reveal a secret number e
        declared during the previous week, specifying its plaintext.
        Parties CANNOT reveal a secret number that is higher than the
        number of tokens transferred to the pot during the previous
        week.
      
      * The leader is the party that has revealed the highest secret
        number that is not equal to any other revealed secret number.
        Immediately before the end of the week, transfer all tokens in
        the pot to the leader.
      
      At the end of the third week in which revealing began, the party
      or parties with the most tokens win this tournament, and this
      tournament ends.
