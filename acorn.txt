Administrative Regulations
   This section has regulations enacted by officers, pursuant to Rule
   2630.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regulation PA0/0
Certification

      For the Promotor to cause a proposal to become pending with 2+N
      support, where N is equal to the number of times e has done so in
      the past 7 days, is for em to certify it.
      
      A proposal is certifiable if:
      1. it is reasonably narrowly tailored to fix one or more problems,
         including a) bugs, b) errors, c) ambiguities, and d)
         vulnerabilities*; or
      2. unusual or exigent circumstance render it in the public
         interest for it to become pending via this method.
      
      * Note: Any of these problems may arise from a single source or
        the interaction of multiple sources, which may be individually
        unproblematic. This provision is to be interpreted broadly and
        flexibly to effectuate its spirit.
      
      The Promotor SHOULD NOT certify a non-certifiable proposal.
      Players SHOULD support an intent to certify a proposal if and only
      if it is certifiable.
      
      The author of a proposal in the pool CAN, by announcement, request
      certification of the proposal, provided e does so in a message
      that has either "Promotor" or "Proposal" in the subject line; e
      SHOULD NOT do so unless e believes eir proposal is certifiable and
      is ENCOURAGED to explain why eir proposal is certifiable. Once
      certification is requested, the Promotor SHALL respond publicly
      before publishing the next report that contains the proposal,
      unless the proposal is withdrawn or pended in the interim.
      Petitioning the Promotor to certify a proposal is DEPRECATED.

Regulation PA1/0
Proposal Style Guide

      Players SHOULD format proposals in accordance with the following
      guidelines.  These guidelines represent the Promotor's preferred
      formatting. Most of these guidelines are flexible recommendations,
      but where something is marked as STRONGLY DISCOURAGED, doing it is
      actively inconvenient for the Promotor.
      
      I. Headers and Metadata.
      
      1. Format headers as close as possible to the heading used for
         distributions, which looks like this:
      
      Title: _____
      Adoption index: _._
      Author: ____
      Co-authors: ____, ____
      
      To be clear:
      a) write the fields in that order;
      b) write out all the fields, even the ones that have default
         values; and
      c) write each field on its own line.
      
      2. a) Give proposals titles 35 characters or less.
         b) Giving proposals titles over 70 characters is STRONGLY
            DISCOURAGED.  
      
      II. Bodies.
      
      1. Indent Proposals two spaces per indent level.
      
      2. a) Wrap proposal lines to 80 characters or less.
         b) Making it so the Promotor cannot wrap lines to 80 characters
            or less is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED unless it is absolutely
            unavoidable (e.g.  in the case of URLs).
      
      3. Players are STRONGLY DISCOURAGED from placing markings that
         indicate the start of the proposal's text on the same line as
         the start of the text.

Regulation RA1/1
Tardiness

Regulation RA2/0
Guidelines to Referees for Compiling Weekly Reports

      Courtesy of the illustrious Publius Scribonius Scholasticus, when
      making eir weekly report on blot holdings, a Referee is ENCOURAGED
      to additionally include:
      
      1. A section tracking investigations resulting from a finger being
      pointed of which the Referee is the investigator, which have not
      been concluded at the time of the report’s publishing; e SHOULD
      provide the following fields for each entry:
      
          a. Name of the perp
          b. Name of the person who pointed eir finger
          d. Summary of the available findings at the time of the report
      
      The Referee is strongly DISCOURAGED from reporting on
      investigations of which e is not the investigator. At the time of
      the promulgation of this regulation, the only rule-defined
      circumstance in which the Referee is not the investigator is when
      the Referee is the perp. As such, eir reports on such
      investigations may be misleading and are at a high likelihood of
      violating rule 2471.
      
      2. A section tracking historical changes to the blots possessed by
      persons. If available, the time period tracked is RECOMMENDED to
      begin from approximately two years prior and end at the time of
      the report’s publishing. E SHOULD provide the following columns
      for this section:
      
          a. Name of person in whose possession the number of blots has
             changed
          b. Change in number of blots
          c. Date of change
          d. Reason of change
