      =============
      I. Amendments
      =============
      
      Any participant can propose changes to these regulations.
      However, under the current Agoran ruleset, actual amendments to
      these regulations are governed by Agoran Rule 2495, which stated,
      "These regulations may thereafter be amended only by the Herald or
      eir designee Without 3 Objections." (and this may have been
      changed, or may be changed in the interim/proceedings, via the
      Agoran ruleset.)
      
      ===========
      II. Joining
      ===========
      
      Any person CAN become a participant by announcement any time
      before the alarm has been sounded.
      
      Any participant CAN cease to be a participant by announcement.
      
      ==========

      The following are the Roles and their corresponding win
      conditions:
      
      Protector - Agoran't is not ossified at any point in time between
      the beginning of Agoran't and the end of this contest.

      the most reports that pass a standard of acceptance, such as
      ratification.
      
      Spoiler - If the only other participants that would win are
      Protectors or Destroyers, the Spoiler also wins.
      
      The Available Roles are the first N roles on the following list,
      where N is the number of participants at Role Assignment. If there
      are more participants than roles, cycle through the list of roles
      until N is met.
      
      List: Protector, Destroyer, Adder, Subtracter, Protector,
      Metawinner, Destroyer, Employee, Spoiler.
      
      =======================
      IV. Rules and Gamestate
      =======================
      
      When the alarm is sounded, the following occur immediately and in
      order:
      - No former rules exist. No proposals exist and no Agoran
        decisions are ongoing. Otherwise, in general, initial gamestate
        is to be construed as default or empty.
      
      - Agoran't begins with the ruleset in this message:
        https://mailman.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/private/agora-business/2023-June/051757.html
      
      - In the context of Agoran't, the publicity of
        "https://agoranomic.groups.io/g/agorant" is set to "public".
      
      - All participants of this contest become players of Agoran't.
      
      - For the purposes of quorum and otherwise, an AI-1 referendum on
        an ordinary proposal with ID 0, title "Dummy proposal", author
        4st, no coauthors, AI 1, and empty text was resolved as FAILED
        QUORUM, having no voters, and having been initiated 3 weeks
        prior.
      
      - For the purposes of activity and otherwise, all players are
        considered to have made eir last announcement.
      
      - All unmentioned switches have their default value(s).
      
      - The results of all CFJs that have been judged in Agora are
        considered "past judgments" in Agoran't.
      
      ============
      V. Beginning
      ============
      
      If it has been 4 days since the beginning of this contest and e
      has not already done so, the Gamemaster and two other chosen
      players CAN and SHALL distribute roles to each participant such
      that only available roles are given out, each participant receives
      a role, and nobody knows who received which role.
      
      When the Gamemaster is confident this has occurred, e CAN once and
      SHALL, in a timely manner, "set the alarm" by announcement.  The
      alarm is sounded at the beginning of the first day that starts 24
      hours or more after the alarm is set.
      
      ======================
      VI. Ending and Winning
      ======================
      
      Ossification, for the purposes of winning the tournament, is taken
      to mean: "Agoran't is ossified if it is IMPOSSIBLE for any
      reasonable combination of actions by players to cause arbitrary
      rule changes to be made and/or arbitrary proposals to be adopted
      within a real-world (UTC) four-week period."
      
      Similarly, for other roles and their win conditions (such as
      Employee), if there exists an ambiguity about it, the Agoran
      Ruleset should be taken into consideration to provide a judgement.
      
      When 1 second less than 90 days has passed since the initiation of
      this tournament, the following occur, in order:
      - All participants SHOULD reveal eir roles, and all participants
        whose role's win condition have been fulfilled win the
        tournament.
      - this tournament ends.
      - Agoran't SHOULD stop running when the tournament ends.
