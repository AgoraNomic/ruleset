Administrative Regulations
   This section has regulations enacted by officers, pursuant to Rule
   2630.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regulation AA0/1
Obligations on the Arbitor

      The Arbitor SHALL NOT assign a case to any person with a clear
      conflict of interest in its outcome.
      
      While there are players interested in judging, the Arbitor SHALL
      NOT assign cases to any other person. A player is "interested in
      judging" whenever e has communicated to the Arbitor that e is or
      will be (syn. "stood up"), provided that, since e last became
      interested, e has not done any of the following:
      * Been recused from a case for lateness.
      * Communicated to the contrary (syn. "sat down").
      * Become inactive.
      * Become deregistered.
      * Been omitted from a list of interested judges published by the
        Arbitor, if the list has been continuously undoubted for one
        week after its publication.
      
      The above notwithstanding, the Arbitor MAY always assign a case to
      emself; to the Referee; or to any person who has communicated to
      em an interest in judging the case (syn. "favoured" the case).
      
      If, but for this provision, this regulation would make it ILLEGAL
      for the Arbitor to assign a particular case at all, all other
      provisions of this regulation are null and void with respect to
      that case.
      
      When a judgement is issued that has major implications for the
      interpretation of a rule, and it is highly unlikely that the rule
      will be changed to alter the interpretation or the case reopened
      in the near future, the Arbitor SHALL in an officially timely
      fashion write a brief description of the implication and
      communicate it to the Rulekeepor with a recommendation for
      inclusion in the Full Logical Ruleset. (This duty is immediately
      discharged if the office of Rulekeepor is vacant.)

Regulation AA2/0
Recommendations for players

      It is RECOMMENDED to phrase CFJ statements so that they are
      possible to parse without outside context. For example, refer to a
      proposal or rule by ID number, or to a message by distinguishing
      features like its author and approximate timestamp, instead of
      writing "this proposal" or "that message". (An exception is
      self-references: "this CFJ", or "this message" meaning "the
      message in which this CFJ is called", is unambiguous and in fact
      traditional.)
      
      When calling a CFJ, players SHOULD ensure that the word "CFJ" is
      present in the subject line of the message, ideally near the
      beginning and ideally distinct from the rest of the line (e.g.
      "[CFJ]" or "CFJ:"). This helps ensure the CFJ is not missed.
      
      Gratuitous arguments to a CFJ need not be explicitly marked, or
      even submitted to a public forum (though they may be, for
      disambiguation). Anything seen by the Arbitor, through any forum,
      that looks like an argument will be accepted and recorded.
      (Arguments may even be submitted privately, which might be useful
      if, for example, anonymity is requested.)
      
      For other actions related to the office of Arbitor, such as
      judgements themselves, recusals, retractions, Motions and Moots,
      it is RECOMMENDED to draw the Arbitor's attention somehow if they
      are buried in replies to an unrelated thread. Otherwise, tags of
      the form "attn. Arbitor" or "@Arbitor" are unnecessary and indeed
      DISCOURAGED as they clutter subject lines.

Subgame Ideas Tournament
   This section has regulations governing the 2025 "subgame ideas" free
   tournament.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regulation FT1/0
Suggesting Pre-Proposals

      A  Pre-Proposal is a type of entity consisting of a body of text
      and other attributes. A player CAN suggest a Pre-Proposal by
      announcement, specifying its text and an associated title.
      
      When a Pre-Proposal is suggested, the player that suggested it
      becomes one of the authors of that Pre-Proposal. An author of a
      Pre-Proposal can make another player become an author of that
      Pre-Proposal by announcement.

Regulation FT2/0
Role of the Gamemaster

      Snail is the Gamemaster for this tournament, and shall publish a
      list of all Pre-Proposals and their authors each week, though e
      may leave out Pre-Proposals made obsolete by newer versions of
      themselves. The Gamemaster can amend these regulations with 2
      Agoran Consent. Any player can amend these regulations with 3
      Agoran Consent. The Gamemaster shall resolve any ambiguities in
      these regulations in the direction of properly rewarding any
      players that substantially contributed to the creation of future
      subgames.

Regulation FT4/0
General Guidelines

      This regulation only contains general guidelines that SHOULD be
      followed during the course of this tournament.
      
      Pre-Proposals should be suggested with the input of multiple
      players and attempt to embody the Agoran Subgame Principles
      (listed below). Heavy iteration is encouraged, and all players
      should voice their likes and dislikes of certain mechanics and
      gameplay loops in each Pre-Proposal.
      
      Finalizing should be attempted on any Pre-Proposal that lacks
      criticism for a week. Such criticism should focus on gameplay
      effects rather than specific wording, as proofreading can be done
      at the conclusion of the tournament. The tournament is a place for
      brainstorming a large amount of varying ideas and cutting away at
      anything that wouldn't work in service of finding viable ideas
      that also interest the Agoran population.
      
      Agoran Subgame Principles (including the work of ais523):
      
      * Nomic is a game of changing rules at its core. Subgames should
        include the proposal system and potential rule changes in their
        gameplay loop.
      
      * A subgame should be intuitive for new players to understand.
        Getting bogged down by complicated rules detracts from the
        experience. Don't forget this principle when it comes time to
        finalize wording.
      
      * Have a hook! Some kind of game, genre, or theme for the subgame
        to build around as it changes. There should be clear places to
        add on but no indication of exactly what should be added. Let
        players direct their creativity into the subgame.
      
      * A subgame shouldn't be too fast or too slow. The generally
        accepted agoran participation minimum is once a week to keep up
        with everything.  This isn't to say gameplay must be limited to
        once a week or can't be less frequent, but it is a good starting
        point to base any time constraints on.
      
      * Utilize existing mechanics (Radiance, Stamps, Tabled Actions,
        the boulder.) Having the subgame be interconnected with the rest
        of the rules gives players more reasons to care about it.
      
      * A subgame should be straightforward for an officer to track. The
        ideal amount of officer work is zero, but if a subgame is poorly
        optimized, an officer might have to take an hour to make a
        report.  Consider example gameplay for officer workflow, and
        include intuitive mechanics that only need a few things to be
        tracked.
      
      * Avoid "grindy" subgames. Having to take an action every week can
        cause players that miss a week to fall behind and lose interest.
        New players should be able to engage with subgame without
        feeling hopeless.
      
      * Start simple. The subgame can get more complex as rules are
        added and dominant strategies are discovered and changed. Making
        a complicated subgame immediately will make it harder for
        players to engage. Lean on easily understood gameplay loops and
        existing mechanics if you must include something complex. The
        average agoran should be able to grasp the subgame within a few
        minutes of reading the rules.
      
      * Aim for emergent gameplay. If the optimal move is easy to
        calculate, there's not much point in playing a game. The
        uncertainty of proposals in your subgame can help remedy this.
      
      * See if you can include burst-style gameplay in your subgame.
        Planning out the perfect move and then executing it is a tried
        and true Agoran gameplay loop. Give players things to plan for
        and think about in advance, and allow for explosive combos.
      
      * Consider if you want the subgame to be competitive or not.
        Losing progress on a win has to feel fair. Determine how often a
        player can win your subgame. If wins happen more than once a
        quarter it may make wins less valuable. Strike a balance that
        makes the win hard, but achievable by perhaps a few players.
        Don't leave out players that are behind in a subgame.
      
      * Make your subgame accessible for players that have to become
        inactive, or can't be available certain days. If players have to
        miss important events, they should be able to play despite that.
        Avoid timing scams.
      
      * Think outside the box! Don't be afraid try something that
        wouldn't fit in the current Agoran framework. It's changed
        before, after all. Emphasize creativity, originality, and fun
        above all else! We'll find a way to implement it if players want
        it.
      
      Players are encouraged to form committees for coming up with great
      ideas in order to win the tournament. Group chats for quick
      brainstorming and rapid-fire ideas are recommended.
