Regulation AA0/0
Obligations on the Arbitor

      The Arbitor SHALL NOT assign a case to any person with a clear
      conflict of interest in its outcome.
      
      While there are players interested in judging, the Arbitor SHALL
      NOT assign cases to any other person. A player is "interested in
      judging" whenever e has communicated to the Arbitor that e is or
      will be (syn. "stood up"), provided that, since e last became
      interested, e has not done any of the following:
      * Exceeded a time limit to judge a case by more than 7 days.
      * Been recused from a case for lateness.
      * Communicated to the contrary (syn. "sat down").
      * Become inactive.
      * Become deregistered.
      * Been omitted from a list of interested judges published by the
        Arbitor, if the list has been continuously undoubted for one
        week after its publication.
      
      The above notwithstanding, the Arbitor MAY always assign a case to
      emself; to the Referee; or to any person who has communicated to
      em an interest in judging the case (syn. "favoured" the case).
      
      If, but for this provision, this regulation would make it ILLEGAL
      for the Arbitor to assign a particular case at all, all other
      provisions of this regulation are null and void with respect to
      that case.
      
      When a judgement is issued that has major implications for the
      interpretation of a rule, and it is highly unlikely that the rule
      will be changed to alter the interpretation or the case reopened
      in the near future, the Arbitor SHALL in an officially timely
      fashion write a brief description of the implication and
      communicate it to the Rulekeepor with a recommendation for
      inclusion in the Full Logical Ruleset. (This duty is immediately
      discharged if the office of Rulekeepor is vacant.)

Regulation AA2/0
Recommendations for players

      It is RECOMMENDED to phrase CFJ statements so that they are
      possible to parse without outside context. For example, refer to a
      proposal or rule by ID number, or to a message by distinguishing
      features like its author and approximate timestamp, instead of
      writing "this proposal" or "that message". (An exception is
      self-references: "this CFJ", or "this message" meaning "the
      message in which this CFJ is called", is unambiguous and in fact
      traditional.)
      
      When calling a CFJ, players SHOULD ensure that the word "CFJ" is
      present in the subject line of the message, ideally near the
      beginning and ideally distinct from the rest of the line (e.g.
      "[CFJ]" or "CFJ:"). This helps ensure the CFJ is not missed.
      
      Gratuitous arguments to a CFJ need not be explicitly marked, or
      even submitted to a public forum (though they may be, for
      disambiguation). Anything seen by the Arbitor, through any forum,
      that looks like an argument will be accepted and recorded.
      (Arguments may even be submitted privately, which might be useful
      if, for example, anonymity is requested.)
      
      For other actions related to the office of Arbitor, such as
      judgements themselves, recusals, retractions, Motions and Moots,
      it is RECOMMENDED to draw the Arbitor's attention somehow if they
      are buried in replies to an unrelated thread. Otherwise, tags of
      the form "attn. Arbitor" or "@Arbitor" are unnecessary and indeed
      DISCOURAGED as they clutter subject lines.
