The enacting instrument may specify a\n   title for the new rule, which if present shall prevail. The ID\n   number of the new rule cannot be specified by the enacting\n   instrument; any attempt to so specify is null and void.\n\n2. repeal a rule. When a rule is repealed, it ceases to be a rule,\n   its power is set to 0, and the Rulekeepor need no longer\n   maintain a record of it.\n\n3. reenact a rule. A repealed rule identified by its most recent\n   rule number MUST be reenacted with the same ID number. If no\n   text is specified, the rule is reenacted with the same text it\n   had when it was most recently repealed. If the reenacting\n   proposal provides new text for the rule, the rule SHOULD have\n   materially the same purpose as did the repealed version. Unless\n   specified otherwise by the reenacting instrument, a reenacted\n   rule has power equal to the power it had at the time of its\n   repeal (or power 1, if power was not defined at the time of\n   that rule's repeal).

If a\nspecification would ever be interpreted as causing multiple\nchanges to happen at once, it is instead interpreted as attempting\nto cause them to occur separately, in the order they are listed in\nthe specification.\n\nAny ambiguity in the specification of a rule change causes that\nchange to be void and without effect. An inconsequential variation\nin the quotation of an existing rule does not constitute ambiguity\nfor the purposes of this rule. Furthermore, if the change being\nspecified would be clear to any reasonable player, the\nspecification is not ambiguous, even if it is incorrect or unclear\non its face. This provision does not prevent the specification of\nundesirable changes; for instance, an amendment which adds a typo\nis not corrected to remove the typo.\n\nA rule change is wholly prevented from taking effect unless its\nfull text was published, along with an unambiguous and clear\nspecification of the method to be used for changing the rule, at\nleast 4 days and no more than 60 days before it would otherwise\ntake effect.\n\nThis rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be\ncreated, modified, or destroyed, or by which an entity can become\na rule or cease to be a rule.\n","power":3},{"title":"Spendies","id":"2690","text":"The Spendor is an office.\n\nSpendies are a currency ownable by players and contracts.
