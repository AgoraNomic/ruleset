To revoke an asset from an entity\nis to destroy it from that entity's possession.\n\nFor entity A to take an asset from entity B is to transfer it from\nentity B to entity A.\n\nAn asset generally CAN be transferred (syn. given) by announcement\nby its owner to another entity, subject to modification by its\nbacking document. Attempts to transfer no assets are successful. A\nfixed asset is one defined as such by its backing document, and\nCANNOT be transferred except as explicitly specified by its\nbacking document; any other asset is liquid.\n\nWhen a rule indicates creating, destroying, or transferring an\namount of assets that is not a natural number, the specified\namount is rounded up to the nearest natural number after all other\ncalculations.\n","power":3},{"title":"Holidays","id":"1769","text":"The period each year from midnight GMT on the morning of 24\nDecember to the beginning of the first Agoran week to begin after\n2 January is a Holiday.\n\nThe week that contains the beginning of Agora's Birthday,\ntogether with the following week, is a Holiday.\n\nIf a person breaks a Rule by missing a deadline that occurs during\na Holiday, punishment is generally not appropriate.\n","power":3}],"enacted_rules":["101","1698","869","478","2139","1789","2646","2678","2679","2152","2509","2125","1023","1728","2124","2518","2505","2681","1586","2162","1688","2140","2350","2625","2606","1607","2137","106","2141","217","1030","2240","105","2493","2486","1051","1681","2221","2429","2614","693","107","2528","683","208","955","879","2422","2127","2168","1950","2034","1006","2630","2651","2154","2573","2160","2689","2691","2138","2472","2143","2677","2667","2632","2603","2379","2698","2616","417","1551","2202","2201","2555","2556","2478","2676","2531","991","591","911","2175","2492","2246","2471","2450","2466","2618","2519","1742","2608","2166","2576","2577","2578","2579","2659","2701","2499","2585","2690","2699","2656","2704","2705","2706","2707","2708","2709","2710","2711","2712","2713","2714","2449","2465","2553","2438","2480","2481","649","2415","1367","2231","2581","2582","103","104","2423","2463","2451","2575","2327","2686","1727","2464","2566","2495","1769","2029","2694","2683","2695","2702","2703"],"category_names":{"The Game of Agora":{"name":"The Game of Agora","description":"This section includes a few rules concerning the Nature of the Game\nof Agora."},"Players":{"name":"Players","description":"This small section provides some rules detailing how joining and\nleaving Agora works.
