------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1698/7 (Power=4)
Agora Is A Nomic

      Agora is ossified if it is IMPOSSIBLE for any reasonable
      combination of actions by players to cause arbitrary rule changes
      to be made and/or arbitrary proposals to be adopted within a
      real-world (UTC) four-week period.
      
      If, but for this rule, the net effect of a proposal would cause
      Agora to become ossified, or would cause Agora to cease to exist,
      it cannot take effect, rules to the contrary notwithstanding. If
      any other single change or inseparable group of changes to the
      gamestate would cause Agora to become ossified, or would cause
      Agora to cease to exist, it is cancelled and does not occur, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.

========================================================================
Players
   This small section provides some rules detailing how joining and
   leaving Agora works. If you're a new player, this is probably the
   most important section to read.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 869/55 (Power=3)
How to Join and Leave Agora

      Any entity (including a group of entities confederated with the
      intent of forming a single person under this Rule) that is or ever
      was able to willingly communicate original ideas is a person.
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no other entities are
      persons.
      
      Questions about personhood are to be resolved equitably, with
      regard for the good-faith of those involved and the customs of
      honorable play.
      
      Citizenship is a secured person switch with values Unregistered
      (default) and Registered, tracked by the Registrar. A registered
      person is a Player. To "register" someone is to flip that person's
      Citizenship switch from Unregistered to Registered.
      
      An Unregistered person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or
      prevented by Rules of power 3 or greater) register by publishing a
      message that indicates reasonably clearly and reasonably
      unambiguously eir desire to be a player at that time (for example,
      by saying "I register"). Rules to the contrary notwithstanding,
      two or more persons CANNOT become Registered simultaneously.
      
      The basis of a person is the set of all persons that are
      (recursively) part of em, in addition to emself. Rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding, a person CANNOT become Registered if eir
      basis overlaps with that of any current player.
      
      A player, acting as emself, CAN deregister (cease being a player)
      by announcement. If e does so, e CANNOT register or be registered
      for 30 days.
      
      A person, by registering, agrees to abide by the Rules. The Rules
      CANNOT otherwise bind a person to abide by any agreement without
      that person's willful consent.
      
      The Rules CANNOT compel non-players to act without their express
      or reasonably implied consent. The rules CANNOT compel players to
      unduly harass non-players. A non-person CANNOT be a player, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.

Annotations:
CFJ 1275 (called 19 Feb 2001): An entity is a Player if the Rules cannot
    distinguish that entity from a Player.
CFJ 1263 (called 05 Feb 2001): Any message expressing a clear desire or
    intent to register as a Player counts as a request for registration,
    whether or not it is explicitly phrased in the manner stipulated by
    the rules.
CFJ 3558 (called 06 Sep 2017): Registering by publishing that you want
    to be a player is a different mechanism than registering "by
    announcement" and so gets around rules limitations on "registering
    by announcement".
CFJ 3625 (called 12 Feb 2018): The rules don't bind recently
    deregistered players to avoid re-registering, they merely declare
    such attempts ineffective. Also, agreeing to be bound by some of the
    rules doesn't count as agreeing to be bound by all of them.
CFJ 3455 (called 03 Aug 2016): Ratifying an unregistered person as a
    player fails without that person's willful consent.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 478/42 (Power=3)
Fora

      Publicity is a secured forum switch with values Public,
      Discussion, and Foreign (default), tracked by the Registrar.
      
      The Registrar CAN change the publicity of a forum without
      objection as long as:
      
      1. e sends eir announcement of intent to that forum; and
      
      2. if the forum is to be made public, the announcement by which
         the Registrar makes that forum public is sent to all existing
         public fora.
      
      Each player should ensure e can receive messages via each public
      forum.
      
      A public message is a message sent via a public forum, or sent to
      all players and containing a clear designation of intent to be
      public. A rule can also designate that a part of one public
      message is considered a public message in its own right. To
      "publish" or "announce" something is to send a public message
      whose body contains that thing. To do something "publicly" is
      to do that thing within a public message.
      
      Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
      announcement", that person performs that action by, in a single
      public message, specifying the action and setting forth intent to
      perform that action by sending that message, doing both clearly
      and unambiguously.
      
      Any action performed by sending a message is performed at the time
      date-stamped on that message. Actions in messages (including
      sub-messages) are performed in the order they appear in the
      message, unless otherwise specified. Allowing actions performed by
      sending a message to take place simultaneously must be done
      explicitly and is secured at power 2.

Annotations:
CFJ 1451-1452 (called 06 Mar 2003): A message that is split into
    multiple email messages can qualify as a single message for game
    purposes, if it is obvious how to combine the parts to reconstruct
    the single message.
CFJ 813 (called 22 Oct 1995): A Player need not prove that e can receive
    the PF.
CFJ 831 (called 10 Nov 1995): 'The Date: header of a message is not
    necessarily the time at which the message takes effect.'
CFJ 2205 (called 02 Oct 2008): A message takes effect at exactly one of
    the times date-stamped on it; selecting which one is a matter of
    game custom.
CFJ 2212 (called 07 Oct 2008): An IRC channel is a forum.
CFJ 2211 (called 07 Oct 2008): It is generally possible for an IRC
    channel to be a public forum.
CFJ 2214 (called 07 Oct 2008): Some IRC messages, such as NICK, are sent
    to all members of an IRC channel but are not sent via that channel.
CFJ 866 (called 08 Apr 1996): A message is "received" when the message
    enters the recipient's normal technical domain of control, whether
    this be eir private machine or eir private account on a shared
    machine (but not the shared machine itself, if the recipient does
    not control it).
CFJ 1112: In order to submit a Proposal, in the sense of R1865 and
    elsewhere, it is not sufficient that a collection of text 'with the
    clear indication that that text is intended to become a Proposal'
    (R1483) merely be sent to the Public Forum by a Proposing Entity;
    the collection of text must also be received in the Public Forum.
CFJ 1214-1215 (called 14 May 2000): Conditional actions (of the form "If
    X, I do Y") are effective only where the relevant agents (such as
    recordkeepors) are able to conclusively determine the value of the
    conditional from publicly-available information.
CFJ 1314 (called 15 Aug 2001): If a message sent to a public forum is
    rejected by the list moderator, it still qualifies as having been
    sent via a public forum.
CFJ 1905 (called 07 Feb 2008): Regardless of CFJ 1314, a message has not
    been sent via a forum until most persons who have arranged to
    receive messages via the forum receive it.
CFJ 1888 (called 31 Jan 2008): Sending a message to a Discussion Forum,
    or other mailing list except for a Public Forum, does not qualify as
    sending it to all players.
CFJ 1631 (called 29 Apr 2007): Public announcements must be made in the
    message body; the subject line is insignificant.
CFJ 1784 (called 05 Nov 2007): An undescriptive or misleading subject
    line does not deprive the message body of effect.
CFJ 1880 (called 22 Jan 2008): A phrase that would, in the message body,
    cancel the effect of the rest of the message, does not have such an
    effect if it appears in the subject line.
CFJ 1761 (called 30 Sep 2007): Publishing part of a message is a
    different action from publishing the whole message.
CFJ 1646 (called 30 Apr 2007): The act of "publishing" or "announcing"
    is accomplished when the message has left the sender's technical
    domain of control, indicated by one of the "Received:" headers0.
CFJ 1768 (called 22 Oct 2007): The right of participation in the fora is
    the right to participate in them for their intended purposes, and is
    not necessarily infringed by regulations regarding the manner and
    type of participation.
CFJ 1738 (called 29 Aug 2007): An obligation on a player to not publish
    statements that e believes are true would conflict with the right of
    participation in the fora.
CFJ 1719 (called 12 Aug 2007): A player can, if e intends, have public
    messages sent on eir behalf, including via a web form that allows
    all-comers to send messages on eir behalf without specific approval.
CFJ 1336 (called 13 Dec 2001): A public statement that one wishes to
    perform an action that one can perform by announcement can
    constitute an announcement that performs that action.
CFJ 1621 (called 08 Feb 2007): Where an action can be performed by
    announcement, announcing that one deems something to be the case
    that would result from that action does not constitute performing
    the action.
CFJ 1584 (called 24 Feb 2006), CFJ 1728 (called 20 Aug 2007): ' Saying
    "I do X 1000 times", where X is something that can be done by
    announcement, is an acceptable shorthand for 1000 instances of "I do
    X", but this shorthand cannot be used with an infinite repeat count,
    because it is impossible to write out an infinite number of
    instances of "I do X".'
CFJ 1774 (called 01 Nov 2007): Saying "I do X 10000 times", where X is
    something that can be done by announcement, does not necessarily
    achieve 10000 instances of X, if writing out 10000 instances of "I
    do X" would be a substantial effort such that using the shorthand is
    abusive. The presumption is in favour of the shorthand being
    successful.
CFJ 1775 (called 01 Nov 2007): If an announcement of the form "I do X N
    times" is not be acceptable shorthand for N instances of "I do X",
    then the announcement is completely nullified, and does not have the
    effect of M instances of "I do X" for any non-zero repeat count M.
CFJ 1730 (called 22 Aug 2007): An appropriate announcement will
    accomplish an action even if its author believed the action was
    impossible.
CFJ 1841 (called 20 Dec 2007): A message-based action cannot be
    retroactive.
CFJ 1971 (called 22 May 2008): An announcement with a general disclaimer
    as to its contents cannot fulfill a requirement to report
    information, but it may successfully cause game actions to be taken
    if the actions do not depend on the truth value of the disclaimed
    contents.
CFJ 2133 (called 09 Aug 2008): A disclaimed statement cannot cause an
    action to be taken by announcement.
CFJ 2112 (called 23 Jul 2008): An action is only taken by announcement
    if the Rules define it as such; e.g., posting an objection to a
    dependent action is not an action taken by announcement.
CFJ 2151 (called 05 Sep 2008): Some unregulated actions, such as
    celebrating and revealing things, can be taken by announcement.
CFJ 2086 (called 15 Jul 2008): Message-based actions are always taken in
    some order, never precisely simultaneously, possibly unless
    otherwise stated.
CFJ 2179 (called 23 Sep 2008): An message-based action can be taken even
    if its sender cannot be identified.
CFJ 2221 (called 13 Oct 2008): When an action is specified as "can do X
    in order to do Y", and a player does X without specifying intent to
    do Y, e does not do Y.
CFJ 2238 (called 22 Oct 2008): The requirement of unambiguous
    specification applies to the parameters of an action.
CFJ 2363 (called 01 Feb 2009): "X can do Y by doing Z" does not imply
    that X can do Z.
CFJ 2441 (called 06 Apr 2009): Due to a limitation of the mailing list
    archives, attaching a message with a particular text does not count
    as publishing that text.
CFJ 3106 (called 19 Oct 2011): When a person announces that "e performs"
    an action, the referent of "e" (i.e. eir identity) must be clear.
CFJ 3002 (called 19 Apr 2011): A message of the form "This statement
    causes {action}" is ineffective as a way to perform {action}, and
    may be an attempt to act on behalf of the statement.
CFJ 2899 (called 12 Nov 2010): A player's real name does not necessary
    identify em.
CFJ 3409 (called 09 Apr 2014): An action can be performed in the subject
    line of a message, if it sufficiently clear (as outlined in the
    judgment).
CFJ 3603-3604 (called 16 Nov 2017): ASCII art of text can be clear
    enough to suffice for communications, and in particular for taking
    actions by announcement.
CFJ 3630 (called 02 Mar 2018): An action referencing outside content
    requires that the attempt to act is clear, the nature of the
    attempted action is clear, and the outside context cannot be altered
    by em and will remain available long enough for others to interpret
    it.
CFJ 3642 (called 15 Jun 2018): Regardless of CFJ 1314, a message has not
    been sent via a public forum if its non-reception by some persons
    who arranged to receive it has affected which game actions they
    chose to take or not to take.
CFJ 3790 (called 01 Jan 2020): The sender of a message is the last
    exerciser of free will that exercised free will on its path.
CFJ 3884 (called 06 Sep 2020): A forum is an open medium for
    communication.
CFJ 3855 (called 22 Jun 2020): Emails from two or more persons never
    constitute one Agoran message.
CFJ 3948 (called 05 Mar 2022): Sending a message "to" a player via a
    nonpublic forum requires, at minimum, explicit signaling of the
    intended recipient in a forum-dependent manner.
CFJ 3663 (called 24 Sep 2018): Player-introduced (non-rules) jargon may
    count as "clear" communication, but must pass various tests of
    clarity and usage to be acceptable as a general shorthand.
CFJ 4001 (called 07 Nov 2022): For an announcement to be clear and
    unambiguous, any conditionals it contains must be determinate at the
    time it is made.  Conditionals that depend on future state do not
    meet this standard.
CFJ 3885 (called 04 Oct 2020): Message metadata (such as subject) is not
    considered to be part of a public message.
CFJ 4103 (called 10 Jan 2025): If a forum is a mailing list, the content
    of an email message sent via that forum is the content of the email
    sent out to the mailing list's subscribers, even if the mailing list
    software presents the message differently in other contexts, such as
    a web interface or archival format.

CFJ 1361 (called 07 May 2002): Purporting to assign a new nickname,

CFJ 1489 (called 11 Feb 2004): Watchers are not a rule-defined element

Cantus Cygneus

      Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously by
      the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part of
      it, e may submit a document to the Registrar, clearly labeled a
      Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and expressing eir
      reproach for those who e feels have treated em so badly.
      
      In a timely fashion after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the
      Registrar shall publish this document along with a Writ of
      Fugiendae Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione, commanding the Player
      to be deregistered. The Registrar shall note the method of
      deregistration for that Player in subsequent Registrar monthly
      Reports.
      
      The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and the
      notation in the Registrar's monthly report will ensure that,
      henceforth, all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of
      FAGE.

Activity

      Activity is a secured player switch tracked by the Registrar, with
      values Active (default) and Inactive.  To flip a player's activity
      to active (inactive) is to activate (deactivate) em.  The date on
      which each player's activity was last changed is part of the
      Registrar's weekly report.
      
      A player CAN, acting as emself, activate or deactivate emself by
      announcement.
      
      Any player CAN, with notice, make a player who has not made a
      public announcement in the past 30 days inactive.
      
      If a player has been inactive continuously for the past 60 days,
      then any player CAN deregister em without 3 objections. The
      Registrar SHOULD attempt to deregister players who meet this
      condition. The publication of intent for such a deregistration
      SHOULD be sent to the inactive player's registered email address
      at the same time that it is published.

Rule 2678/1 (Power=3)
Expectations of Participation

      An "Agoran forum" is a forum with publicity of discussion or
      public. Players of Agora have the following expectations of Agoran
      fora:
      
      * Agoran fora allow equal participation for all players, subject
        to the rules of Agora and the explicitly stated rules of the
        fora.
      
      * The rules of participation in public fora are as closely aligned
        with the rules of Agora itself as possible; a player expects to
        be able to fully participate in all public fora as long as eir
        participation is in line with Agora's rules.
      
      * Agoran fora allow all interested persons, even those that are
        otherwise restricted in eir participation, to read all messages.
      
      * Discussion fora moderators may restrict participation subject to
        eir own clearly stated rules but should only do so to players
        temporarily and proportional to the harm of the rule breakage.
      
      * The content of discussion fora should primarily be about Agora
        itself, or reasonably adjacent topics.
      
      If an existing Agoran forum is in violation of these expectations,
      the Agoran community, led by the Registrar, SHOULD remove it or
      replace it with an appropriate forum as soon as possible.

Rule 2679/2 (Power=3)
Restrictions on Participation

      Banned is a secured negative boolean person switch tracked by the
      Registrar. A person is unwelcome if e is Banned or if at least one
      part of em is unwelcome. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, an
      unwelcome person CANNOT register or be registered, and e is
      immediately deregistered if e is ever a player. Designations of
      unwelcomeness are secured.
      
      A Banned switch SHOULD ONLY be flipped by a proposal for the
      express purpose of flipping Banned switches.
      
      Flipping a Banned switch to True (banning a player) SHOULD ONLY be
      done when:
      
      * the person's actions have been deemed harmful to Agora, to any
        player of Agora, or the overall community, and
      
      * the harm has been clearly communicated to the person, and e has
        been given time to consider and respond, and
      
      * e has made no attempt to make amends, eir attempt was
        unsatisfactory, or e has continued to act in harmful ways.
      
      Actions that are harmful are subject to the discretion of the
      community of Agora, but may include: any form of identity-based
      discrimination, personal attacks, disrespect of values or beliefs
      of any member of the Agoran community, or provocative/bad-faith
      comments.
      
      Once a quarter, any unwelcome person may submit a Request for
      Forgiveness to the Registrar. Such a document SHOULD contain
      sincere self-reflection including any appropriate apologies and an

General Definitions
   This section describes the terminology used by all the other rules.
   If, when reading a rule, you don't understand what a word means,
   chances are that the Agoran definition of that word is described in
   one of these rules.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2152/11 (Power=3)
Mother, May I?

      The following terms are defined. These definitions are used when a
      rule includes a term in all caps, and provide guidance in
      determining the ordinary-language meaning of a term when a rule
      includes a term otherwise. Earlier definitions take precedence
      over later ones. If a rule specifies one or more persons in
      connection with a term, then the term applies only to the
      specified person(s).
      
      1. CANNOT, IMPOSSIBLE, INEFFECTIVE, INVALID: Attempts to perform
         the described action are unsuccessful.
      
      2. MUST NOT, MAY NOT, SHALL NOT, ILLEGAL, PROHIBITED: Performing
         the described action violates the rule in question.
      
      3. NEED NOT, OPTIONAL: Failing to perform the described action
         does not violate the rules.
      
      4. SHOULD NOT, DISCOURAGED, DEPRECATED: Before performing the
         described action, the full implications of performing it ought
         to be be understood and carefully weighed.
      
      5. CAN, POSSIBLE, EFFECTIVE, VALID: Attempts to perform the
         described action are successful.
      
      6. MAY, LEGAL, PERMISSIBLE: Performing the described action does
         not violate the rules.
      
      7. MUST, SHALL, REQUIRED, MANDATORY: Failing to perform the
         described action violates the rule in question.
      
      8. SHOULD, ENCOURAGED, RECOMMENDED: Before failing to perform the
         described action, the full implications of failing to perform
         it ought to be understood and carefully weighed.

    players are unable to follow a particular rule is not in itself a
    violation of that rule.
CFJ 2395 (called 01 Mar 2009): Even without this being explicitly
    specified in the rules, it is possible for a non-player to violate a
    rule by missing a deadline.
CFJ 1990 (called 07 Jun 2008): "Allowed" may refer to either possibility
    or permissibility depending on context.
CFJ 2230 (called 16 Oct 2008): In a statement of the form "an action
    that X may take", 'may' generally means 'might', i.e. CAN.
CFJ 2282 (called 19 Nov 2008): To state that an entity "MUST" have
    certain properties refers to possibility, not legality.
CFJ 2414 (called 14 Mar 2009): A rule of the form "X SHOULD be
    interpreted as Y" does not allow players to bypass the
    interpretation by failing to perform the described action.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2509/3 (Power=2)
Agoran Numbers

      A "number" is considered to refer to a real number, unless
      otherwise explicitly specified.  A "number of (items)", where
      (items) is a set of discrete entities, is considered to refer to a
      non-negative integer, unless otherwise explicitly specified.
      
      If a switch is defined as being associated with a specified set of
      numbers (a numerical switch), then the possible values for that
      switch are the numbers in that set. In particular, a natural or
      integer switch is a switch with possible values the non-negative
      integers or all integers, respectively. If a limit is further
      defined, the possible values are the numbers of the set within the
      specified limits.
      
      If the rules describe mathematical operations to be used in
      flipping an instance of a numerical switch, the operations are
      interpreted as having common-sense mathematical application to
      determine that instance's resulting value. For example,
      "increasing a switch instance by M" is equivalent to "flipping a
      switch instance from its current value N to the value N+M". If the
      specified mathematical operation would result in a value outside
      that switch's defined set, the flipping CANNOT be performed, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.

Rule 2125/15 (Power=3)
Regulated Actions

      An action is regulated if: (1) the Rules limit, allow, enable, or
      permit its performance; (2) the Rules describe the circumstances
      under which the action would succeed or fail; or (3) the action
      would, as part of its effect, modify information for which some
      player is required to be a recordkeepor.
      
      A Regulated Action CAN only be performed as described by the
      Rules, and only using the methods explicitly specified in the
      Rules for performing the given action. The Rules are not to be
      interpreted so as to proscribe unregulated actions.
      
      The above notwithstanding, sending a message (in general or with
      specific attributes) is never a regulated action; however, the
      rules may be interpreted so as to proscribe sending public
      messages (in general or with specific attributes).

Annotations:
CFJ 3737 (called 15 Jun 2019): Actions that the rules state a player
    SHALL NOT perform are considered to be regulated actions.
CFJ 3793 (called 16 Jan 2020): Rule 2125 is an interpretive principle
    applied to the rules as a whole and not to any individual rule. For
    a method to be explicitly specified, it must actually specify a way
    that the action can be realized; it is not enough that a rule claims
    there is a method. Circular reasoning cannot be used to permit an
    action or to provide a method.
CFJ 3869 (called 18 Jul 2020): Sending messages to fora is not
    regulated, only the potential actions contained therein.
CFJ 3797 (called 22 Jan 2020): Whether coming into existence is
    regulated depends on the thing that is coming into existence. Coming
    into existence is regulated for rules-defined entities and is not
    regulated for entities of which the rules decline to take notice;
    for entities that are not defined by the rules, but of which the
    rules take notice, such as persons, coming into existence is not
    regulated but the collateral consequences (e.g. assigning switch
    values) are.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1023/43 (Power=2)
Agoran Time

      The following terms are defined:
      
      1. The phrase "in a timely fashion" means "within 7 days". This
         time period is set when the requirement is created (i.e. X days
         before the limit ends). A requirement to perform an action at
         an exact instant (e.g. "when X, Y SHALL Z"), but not "in the
         same message", is instead interpreted as a requirement to
         perform that action in a timely fashion after that instant.
      2. The phrase "in an officially timely fashion" means "before the
         end of the next Agoran week". This time period is set when the
         requirement is created (i.e. between 7 and 14 days before the
         period ends).
      3. Agoran epochs:
         a. Agoran days begin at midnight UTC.
         b. Agoran weeks begin at midnight UTC on Monday. Eastman weeks
            begin at midnight UTC on the 1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th
            of each Gregorian month; the fifth one of the month (if any)
            lasts till the end of the month.
         c. Agoran months begin at midnight UTC on the first day of each
            Gregorian month.
         d. Agoran quarters begin when the Agoran months of January,
            April, July, and October begin.
         e. Agoran years begin when the Agoran month of January begins.
         f. A pivot is either the instant at which Agora Nomic began
            (June 30, 1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200) or an instant at which
            at least one person won the game. When used as a period of
            time, a "Round" (historical syn: "game") is the period of
            time between a pivot and the next pivot.
         The "Agoran" qualifier is assumed unless a different definition
         is indicated (e.g. Eastman weeks). These definitions do not
         apply to relative durations (e.g. "within <number> days after
         <event>").
      4. Two points in time are within a month of each other if:
         a. they occur in the same Agoran month;
         b. they occur in two consecutive Agoran months, and the later
            of the two occurs in an earlier day in the month than the
            earlier one;
         c. they occur in two consecutive Agoran months on the same day
            of the month, and the later of the two occurs at the same or
            earlier time of day.
      5. Any anniversary, monthly anniversary, or quarterly anniversary
         that would otherwise attempt to occur on a day of the month
         that does not exist (after considering any leap day) instead
         occurs on the first day of the following month.

    weeks.
CFJ 3873 (called 08 Aug 2020): Depending on context, it can be the
    anniversary of an event on the day that event first happens.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1728/46 (Power=3)
Tabled Actions

      An action is a Tabled Action if the Rules purport to authorize its
      performance via one of the following methods:
      * With N Support, where N is a positive integer.
      * Without N Objections, where N is a positive integer.
      * With N Agoran Consent, where N is a positive integer multiple of
        0.1.
      * With T notice, where T is a time period.
      
      The parameters N and T, if omitted, default to 1 and 4 days,
      respectively (e.g. "without objection" means N=1). If a rule
      defines N as less than 1, it is instead treated as 1.
      
      A person, acting as emself, CAN by announcement table an intent
      (syn.  "intend") to perform a tabled action, clearly,
      conspicuously, explicitly, and without obfuscation specifying the
      action, the method (including non-default parameter values), and,
      optionally, conditions.
      
      A person is the sponsor of such an intent if e tabled it, or if e
      is authorized to perform its action due to holding a rule-defined
      position previously held by the person who tabled it.

Rule 2124/32 (Power=3)
Performing Tabled Actions

      For a given tabled intent, a player CAN, unless otherwise
      forbidden by the rules or the document enabling the action, act on
      eir own behalf, by announcement, to:
      * Become a supporter ("support" it), unless e tabled or previously
        supported it;
      * Become an objector ("object to" it), unless e previously
        objected to it;
      
      A supporter/objector to an intent, acting as emself, CAN by
      announcement cease to be a supporter/objector ("withdraw"
      support/objection) of that intent.
      
      Limiting the ability to support or object to an intent is secured
      at the power of the rule enabling that action to be performed.
      
      An intent is ripe if was tabled within the past 14 days, the
      Speaker hasn't objected to it in the past 48 hours, and its
      conditions, if any, are each clearly and unambiguously met.
      
      An intent is mature if it was tabled at least 4 days ago and
      nobody withdrew objections from it in the past 24 hours.
      
      A rule purporting to allow a person to perform a tabled action
      allows em to do so by announcement, if, considering only intents
      for that action/method combination:
      * With N Support: e is a sponsor or supporter of a ripe intent with
        at least N supporters.
      * Without N Objections: e is a sponsor of a mature ripe intent with
        less than N objectors.
      * With N Agoran Consent: e is a sponsor or supporter of a mature
        ripe intent with supporters greater than N times its objectors
        (e SHOULD list supporters and objectors).
      * With T notice: e is the sponsor of a ripe intent created at
        least T ago.

Rule 2518/1 (Power=3)
Determinacy

      If a value CANNOT be reasonably determined (without circularity or

      alternates indefinitely between values, then the value is
      considered to be indeterminate, otherwise it is determinate.
      
      A communication purporting to express conditional intent to
      perform an action is considered unclear and ambiguous unless, at a
      minimum, the conditional is determinate, true, and reasonably
      straightforward to evaluate with publicly-available information at
      the time of communication. The communicator SHOULD explain
      specific reasons for being uncertain of the outcome when e makes
      the communication.

      When a Rule specifies that a random choice be made, then the

      probability distribution.
      
      The choice can be made using any physical or computational process
      whose probability distribution among the possible outcomes is
      reasonably close to that required by the Rules, and for which the
      final choice is not trivially predictable by the selecting person
      in advance. The selecting person SHOULD make the selection method
      public, and SHOULD use a method for which the final probability
      distribution can be readily confirmed.

Acting on Commitment

      A Fingerprint for a document (the Plaintext) is a document that

      that one could not reasonably produce another document related to
      that Fingerprint in the same way.
      
      A person CAN make a commitment to a particular kind of document by
      publishing a statement that purports to be a Fingerprint for a
      document of that kind. If the statement is in fact such a
      Fingerprint, the person CAN then reveal the commitment by
      publishing the Plaintext corresponding to that Fingerprint and
      clearly indicating which Fingerprint the Plaintext relates to.
      
      A person making a commitment SHOULD specify the method used to
      produce the Fingerprint from the Plaintext.

Entities
   "Entity" is a confusing word to new players. This section describes

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1586/9 (Power=2)
Definition and Continuity of Entities

      If multiple rules attempt to define an entity with the same name,
      then they refer to the same entity. A rule-defined entity's name
      CANNOT be changed to be the same as another rule-defined entity's
      name.
      
      A rule, contract, or regulation that refers to an entity by name
      refers to the entity that had that name when the rule first came
      to include that reference, even if the entity's name has since
      changed.
      
      If the entity that defines another entity is amended such that it
      no longer defines the second entity, then the second entity and
      its attributes cease to exist.
      
      If the entity that defines another entity is amended such that it
      defines the second entity both before and after the amendment, but
      with different attributes, then the second entity and its
      attributes continue to exist to whatever extent is possible under
      the new definitions.

Rule 2162/16 (Power=3)
Switches

      A type of switch is a property that a rule or a contract defines
      as a switch (with such rule or contract being its backing
      document) and specifies the following:
      
      1. The type(s) of entity possessing an instance of that switch. No
         other entity possesses an instance of that switch.
      
      2. One or more possible values for instances of that switch,
         exactly one of which should be designated as the default. No
         values other than those listed are possible for instances of
         that switch, except that, if no default is otherwise
         specified, then rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the
         "null" value is a possible value for that switch, and is the
         default.
      
      At any given time, each instance of a switch has exactly one
      possible value for that type of switch. If an instance of a switch
      comes to have a value, it ceases to have any other value. If an
      instance of a switch would otherwise fail to have a possible
      value, it comes to have its default value. A Rule that designates
      a switch as "secured" (at a given power level) designates changes
      to the properties of that type of switch as secured (at that power
      level) and designates changes to the value of each instance of the
      switch as secured (at that power level).
      
      "To flip an instance of a switch" is to make it come to have a
      given value. "To become X" (where X is a possible value of
      exactly one of the subject's switches) is to flip that switch to
      X.
      
      If a type of switch is not explicitly designated as
      possibly-indeterminate by its backing document, and if an action
      or set of actions would cause the value of an instance of that
      type of switch to become indeterminate, that instance instead
      takes on its last determinate and possible value, if any,
      otherwise it takes on its default value.
      
      A singleton switch is a switch for which Agora Nomic is the only
      entity possessing an instance of that switch.
      
      A boolean switch is a switch with values True and False. A
      positive boolean switch has a default of True; a negative boolean
      switch has a default of False.
      
      Attempting to flip an instance of a switch to a value it already
      has does not flip the switch. However, if a person is REQUIRED to
      flip a switch instance to a value it already has, then either
      attempting to do so using the required mechanism, or announcing
      that the switch already has the required value, fulfills the
      requirement without flipping the switch.

Rule 1688/11 (Power=3)
Power

      The Power of an entity is a non-negative rational number. An
      instrument is an entity with positive Power.
      
      The Power of an entity cannot be set or modified except as
      stipulated by the Rules. All entities have Power zero except where
      specifically allowed by the rules.
      
      A Rule that makes a change, action, or value secured (hereafter
      the securing Rule) thereby makes it IMPOSSIBLE to perform that
      change or action, or to set or modify that value, except as
      allowed by an instrument with Power greater than or equal to the
      change's Power Threshold. This Threshold defaults to the securing
      Rule's Power, but CAN be lowered as allowed by that Rule
      (including by the Rule itself).

Proposals
   Proposals are a staple of Nomic games. If you're a new player, this
   is another important section, since the way proposals work in this
   Nomic is a little bit complicated.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2350/19 (Power=3)
Proposals

      A proposal is a type of entity consisting of a body of text and
      other attributes. A player CAN create (syn. submit) a proposal by
      announcement, specifying its text and optionally specifying any of
      the following attributes:
      
      * An associated title.
      
      * A list of coauthors (which must be persons other than the
        author).
      
      * An adoption index.
      
      Creating a proposal adds it to the Proposal Pool. Once a proposal
      is created, its text, author, and AI cannot be changed. The author
      (syn. proposer) of a proposal is the person who created it.
      
      The author of a proposal in the Proposal Pool CAN remove (syn.
      retract, withdraw) it from the Pool by announcement.
      
      The destruction of a proposal and the causing of a proposal to
      cease being a proposal are secured. The removal of a proposal from
      the Proposal Pool, other than by distribution, is secured.

Rule 2625/2 (Power=1.0)
Proposal Recycling

      If a referendum on a proposal was resolved as FAILED QUORUM in the
      past seven days, the Promotor CAN once recycle the proposal by
      announcement, adding it to the Proposal Pool and causing it to
      become pended.

Proposal Classes

      Proposals created since the enactment of this rule have a secured
      untracked Class switch with possible values ordinary (the default)
      and democratic.
      
      When a proposal with an adoption index greater than or equal to
      3.0 is created, its class becomes democratic.
      
      Any player CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, flip an ordinary proposal's
      class to democratic, provided that it is in the Proposal Pool or
      that there is a referendum on it whose voting period has not yet
      ended.

Rule 1607/59 (Power=3)
Distribution

      The Promotor is an office; its holder is responsible for receiving
      and distributing proposals.
      
      A referendum is the Agoran decision to determine whether to adopt
      a proposal (its associated proposal).  For this decision, the vote
      collector is the Assessor, the adoption index is initially the
      adoption index of the proposal, and the text, author, coauthors,
      and class of the proposal are essential parameters. Initiating a
      referendum is known as distribution, and removes the proposal from
      the Proposal Pool.
      
      The Promotor CAN distribute a proposal which is in the Proposal
      Pool at any time.
      
      In a given Agoran week, the Promotor SHALL distribute each
      proposal that was in the Proposal Pool at the beginning of that
      week, except for those excepted from automatic distribution by
      other rules, or those that are otherwise removed from the Pool. If
      there are ten or more undistributed proposals in the proposal
      pool, the Promotor MAY refrain from distributing the most recently
      added 5 proposals if e distributes each other proposal in that
      Agoran week.
      
      Distributed proposals have ID numbers, to be assigned by the
      Promotor.
      
      If there is a Proposal in the Pool that it would otherwise be
      IMPOSSIBLE for any player to distribute, then any player CAN
      distribute that Proposal without 3 objections.
      
      The Promotor's report includes a list of all proposals in the
      Proposal Pool, along with their text and attributes. This portion
      of a public document purporting to be a Promotor's report is
      self-ratifying.
      
      The destruction of a referendum is secured. Causing a referendum
      to cease being a referendum is secured.

Rule 106/46 (Power=3)
Adopting Proposals

      When a referendum on a proposal is resolved, if the outcome is
      ADOPTED, then the proposal in question is adopted, its power is
      set to the minimum of four, the adoption index of the proposal,
      and the adoption index of the referendum, and it takes effect.
      Proposals CANNOT otherwise be adopted or take effect, rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding.
      
      When a proposal takes effect, the proposal applies the changes
      that it specifies in its text, except as prohibited by other
      rules. Unless otherwise specified by the text, the effects are
      applied in the order they appear in the text. Clearly marked
      comments are ignored. If the proposal cannot make some changes it
      specifies, that does not preclude the other changes from taking
      place.
      
      Except insofar as the actions performed by a proposal happen one
      after another, rather than simultaneously, a proposal's effect is
      instantaneous. A proposal can neither delay nor extend its own
      effect.  Once a proposal finishes taking effect, its power is set
      to 0.
      
      No entity with power below the power of this rule can prevent a
      proposal from taking effect; this does not apply to generally
      preventing changes to specified areas of the gamestate, nor to a
      proposal preventing itself from taking effect (its no-effect
      clause is generally interpreted as applying only to the rest of
      the proposal).

========================================================================
Rules & Regulations
   Ah, yes. What would any game be without rules? And these rules
   describe how rules work. This section also describes the governance
   of the Rulekeepor.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2141/16 (Power=3.2)
Role and Attributes of Rules

      A rule is a type of instrument that is always taking effect and
      has the capacity to govern the game generally. A rule's content
      takes the form of a text, and is unlimited in scope. The ruleset
      is the set of all currently-existing rules.
      
      Every current rule has power between 0.1 and 4.0 inclusive.
      
      Every rule shall have an ID number, distinct among current and
      former rules, to be assigned once by the Rulekeepor by public
      designation.
      
      Every rule shall have a title to aid in identification. If a rule
      ever does not have a title, then the Rulekeepor CAN and SHALL
      assign a title to it by announcement in a timely fashion.
      
      For the purposes of rules governing modification of instruments,
      the text, power, ID number, and title of a rule are all
      substantive aspects of the rule. However, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the Rulekeepor CAN set rule aspects as described
      elsewhere in this rule.

Annotations:
CFJ 1498 (called 12 Apr 2004): A rule's title is not strictly a name for
    the rule, and so rule titles are not subject to the uniqueness
    requirement on names of rule-defined entities.
CFJ 2013 (called 17 Jun 2009): Rule 2141 does not imply that the power
    of rules is physically unlimited: they can only affect the world
    outside the game by prescribing or proscribing player behavior.
CFJ 2213 (called 07 Oct 2008): The powers granted to rules by the first
    paragraph of Rule 2141 are general, and only apply as otherwise
    stated by the Rules.
CFJ 2367 (called 05 Feb 2009): A rule need not "govern" anything in the
    game to be a rule, e.g. a rule consisting entirely of nonfunctional
    ASCII art is still a rule.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 217/12 (Power=3)
Interpreting the Rules

      When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
      takes precedence. Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
      unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense, past
      judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the game.
      
      Definitions and prescriptions in the rules are only to be applied
      using direct, forward reasoning; in particular, an absurdity that
      can be concluded from the assumption that a statement about
      rule-defined concepts is false does not constitute proof that it
      is true. Definitions in lower-powered Rules do not overrule
      common-sense interpretations or common definitions of terms in
      higher-powered rules, but may constructively make reasonable
      clarifications to those definitions. For this purpose, a
      clarification is reasonable if and only if it adds detail without
      changing the underlying general meaning of the term and without
      causing the higher powered rule to be read in a way inconsistent
      with its text.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any rule change that would
      (1) prevent a person from initiating a formal process to resolve

      controversy will thereby be resolved; or (2) prevent a person from
      causing formal reconsideration of any judicial determination that

Annotations:
CFJ 1439 (called 20 Feb 2003): A difference in language qualifies as a
    difference in dialect; it is possible to take game actions by
    messages in languages other than English.
CFJ 1460 (called 04 Apr 2003): If a message is in a language other than
    English, and its intended audience does not understand the language,
    this constitutes gross unclarity that makes the message ineffective.
CFJ 712: Referring to a Player by a method other than eir name or
    nickname is acceptable, as long as it is unambiguous.
CFJ 1861 (called 08 Jan 2008): A player's legal name (legal in eir
    country of residence) is not necessarily an acceptable way to refer
    to em.
CFJ 1782 (called 04 Nov 2007): Referring to a player by the name of an
    office that e holds suffices to identify em uniquely as a person, if
    there is no doubt regarding who holds that office.
CFJ 1460 (called 04 Apr 2003): Extremely complex synonyms, requiring
    extensive effort to interpret correctly, can constitute a sufficient
    degree of unclarity as to render the message ineffective.
CFJ 1840 (called 20 Dec 2007): A proper noun that has not been
    explicitly defined does not adequately refer to any entity, and is
    not implicitly defined by the context in which it is used.
CFJ 1580 (called 12 Jan 2006): Base64 encoding of (part of) a message,
    other than in the context of MIME with appropriate headers, can
    render a message ineffective for unclarity, because the decoding
    step requires unreasonable effort within the meaning of CFJ 1460.
CFJ 1741 (called 11 Sep 2007): HTML encoding (including numerical
    character entity encoding) does not render a message ineffective for
    unclarity if a suitable MIME type is indicated by a header.
CFJ 1741 (called 11 Sep 2007): An email message does not need the
    RFC-required "MIME-Version:" header in order for it to be
    interpreted in the MIME way.
CFJ 1770 (called 23 Oct 2007): A contract can redefine a rule-defined
    term in its own way, and the contract's definition will then apply
    in situations governed by the contract.
CFJ 1885 (called 26 Jan 2008): A word or phrase can acquire a meaning by
    custom, provided that it is a reasonable meaning and does not
    unreasonably change the meaning of phrases that already have a
    meaning.
CFJ 1831 (called 10 Dec 2007): Mentioning a URI, without surrounding
    text stating its significance, does not incorporate anything
    identified by that URI into the message that mentions the URI.
CFJ 1831 (called 10 Dec 2007): Character sequences within a URI by
    default have no significance other than their functional role as
    part of the URI.
CFJ 2258 (called 06 Nov 2008): Changes in whitespace are also
    inconsequential.
CFJ 1139: Interpretations {judgements at the time of CFJ 1139} need not
    necessarily accord with the reasoning and arguments of Judges or
    Justices given in past CFJs.
CFJ 3793 (called 16 Jan 2020): The "text of the rules", for the purposes
    of Rule 217, is the text of the rules as actually written, as
    agumented by the  semantic context of applicable definitions.
    Substituting definitions into the text of a rule cannot eliminate
    unclarity caused by ambiguous grammar or other linguistic aspects.
CFJ 3822 (called 19 Mar 2020): In the absence of a reason to think that
    things have changed, they can be presumed to have remained the same.

Rule 1030/13 (Power=3.3)
Precedence between Rules

      In a conflict between Rules, the conflict shall be resolved by
      performing the following comparisons in the sequence written in
      this rule, until the conflict is resolved.
      
      - In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
        the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
        Power; otherwise,
      
      - If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
        precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
        determining precedence relations, then the determinations of the
        precedence-determining Rule shall be used to resolve the
        conflicts; otherwise,
      
      - If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
        itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or takes
        precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
        provisions shall be used to resolve the conflict, unless they
        lead to contradictions between each other; otherwise,
      
      - If any of the rules in conflict have ID numbers, then the Rule
        with the lowest ID number takes precedence; otherwise,
      
      - The Rule enacted earliest takes precedence.
      
      Clauses in any other rule that broadly claim precedence (e.g. over
      "all rules" of a certain class) shall be, prima facie, considered
      to be limited claims of precedence or deference that are
      applicable only when such claims are evaluated as described within
      the above sequence.
      
      No change to the ruleset can occur that would cause a Rule to
      directly claim precedence over this Rule as a means of determining
      precedence. This applies to changes by the enactment or amendment
      of a Rule, or of any other form. This Rule takes precedence over
      any Rule that would permit such a change to the ruleset.

Annotations:
CFJ 1104 (called 20 Aug 1998): The presence in a Rule of deference
    clause, claiming that the Rule defers to another Rule, does not
    prevent a conflict with the other Rule arising, but shows only how
    the Rule says that conflict is to be resolved when it does arise.
CFJ 1114-1115 (called 27 Jan 1999): This Rule is to be applied to
    resolve Rule conflicts on a case-by-case basis; just because a Rule
    is inapplicable in one situation due to conflict with a Rule of
    higher precedence does not mean that the Rule is nullified in all
    cases.
CFJ 3796 (called 20 Jan 2020): If a situation can be arranged where a
    rule claims precedence over the rule defining precedence relations
    (currently R1030), the rules are inconsistent and the rule governing
    rule interpretation (currently R217) resolves the conflict.

Rule 2240/1 (Power=3)

Rule 105/25 (Power=3)
Rule Changes

      When the rules provide that an instrument takes effect, it can
      generally:
      
      1. enact a rule. The new rule has power equal to the minimum of
         the power specified by the enacting instrument, defaulting to
         one if the enacting instrument does not specify or if it
         specifies a power less than 0.1, and the maximum power
         permitted by other rules. The enacting instrument may specify a
         title for the new rule, which if present shall prevail. The ID
         number of the new rule cannot be specified by the enacting
         instrument; any attempt to so specify is null and void.
      
      2. repeal a rule. When a rule is repealed, it ceases to be a rule,
         its power is set to 0, and the Rulekeepor need no longer
         maintain a record of it.
      
      3. reenact a rule. A repealed rule identified by its most recent
         rule number MUST be reenacted with the same ID number. If no
         text is specified, the rule is reenacted with the same text it
         had when it was most recently repealed. If the reenacting
         proposal provides new text for the rule, the rule SHOULD have
         materially the same purpose as did the repealed version. Unless
         specified otherwise by the reenacting instrument, a reenacted
         rule has power equal to the power it had at the time of its
         repeal (or power 1, if power was not defined at the time of
         that rule's repeal). If the reenacting instrument is incapable
         of setting the reenacted rule's power to that value, then the
         reenactment is null and void.
      
      4. amend the text of a rule.
      
      5. retitle a rule.
      
      6. change the power of a rule.
      
      A rule change is any effect that falls into the above classes.
      Rule changes always occur sequentially, never simultaneously. If a
      specification would ever be interpreted as causing multiple
      changes to happen at once, it is instead interpreted as attempting
      to cause them to occur separately, in the order they are listed in
      the specification.
      
      Any ambiguity in the specification of a rule change causes that
      change to be void and without effect. An inconsequential variation
      in the quotation of an existing rule does not constitute ambiguity
      for the purposes of this rule. Furthermore, if the change being
      specified would be clear to any reasonable player, the
      specification is not ambiguous, even if it is incorrect or unclear
      on its face. This provision does not prevent the specification of
      undesirable changes; for instance, an amendment which adds a typo
      is not corrected to remove the typo.
      
      A rule change is wholly prevented from taking effect unless its
      full text was published, along with an unambiguous and clear
      specification of the method to be used for changing the rule, at
      least 4 days and no more than 60 days before it would otherwise
      take effect.
      
      This rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be
      created, modified, or destroyed, or by which an entity can become
      a rule or cease to be a rule.

Annotations:
CFJ 1499 (called 20 Apr 2004), CFJ 1623 (called 01 Apr 2007): If a
    low-power rule states that an officer can repeal the rule under
    certain circumstances, then the rule cannot actually be repealed by
    this process, because the officer, not being an instrument, is
    categorically incapable of performing rule changes; this is
    different from the situation where a rule can be triggered to repeal
    itself.
CFJ 708 (called between 01 Oct 1994 and 31 Oct 1994): An Amendment of a
    non-existing Rule is not a legal Rule Change.
CFJ 1625 (called 01 Apr 2007): Where a proposal specifies a rule to
    amend by both number and title, and the number and title given
    identify different rules, this constitutes ambiguity that nullifies
    the attempted rule change.
CFJ 1644 (called 29 Apr 2007): Where a proposal contains the form of
    words "Change the power of rule NNNN to P and amend it by XXX.",
    where XXX specifies a text change, this constitutes two attempted
    rule changes.
CFJ 1638 (called 29 Apr 2007): Where a proposal contains the form of
    words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX. Amend rule NNNN by YYY.", this
    constitutes two separate attempts at rule changes, even though both
    attempt to amend the same rule.
CFJ 1642 (called 29 Apr 2007): Where a proposal contains the form of
    words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX. Further amend rule NNNN by YYY.",
    where both XXX and YYY specify text changes, this constitutes two
    separate attempts at rule changes.
CFJ 1640 (called 29 Apr 2007): Where a proposal contains the form of
    words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX and YYY.", where both XXX and YYY
    specify text changes, this constitutes a single attempt at a rule
    change, even though it is specified in two parts.
CFJ 1641 (called 29 Apr 2007): Where a proposal contains the form of
    words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX and by YYY.", where both XXX and YYY
    specify text changes, this constitutes a single attempt at a rule
    change, even though it is specified in two parts.
CFJ 1643 (called 29 Apr 2007): Where a proposal specifies a single rule
    amendment in two parts, and one of the parts is not possible but the
    other is possible, the possible part is applied alone.
CFJ 2201 (called 30 Sep 2008): The permission required by Rule 105 need
    not be explicit.
CFJ 3830 (called 12 Apr 2020): Text in a rule cannot cause a rule-change
    after it has been deleted by an amendment.

Rule 2493/11 (Power=3)
Regulations

      A regulation is a textual entity defined as such by a Rule (its
      parent rule) and existing solely because that Rule defines its
      existence. A regulation has no effect other than those that the
      Rules explicitly give it.
      
      A regulation CAN be enacted, amended, and repealed as specified by
      its parent rule. Regulations are tracked by the Rulekeepor as part
      of eir monthly report in a fashion similar to rules.

Rule 1681/28 (Power=1)
The Logical Rulesets

      The Short Logical Ruleset (SLR) is a format of the ruleset. In
      this format, each rule is assigned to a category, and the rules
      are grouped according to their category.
      
      Rules are assigned to, ordered within, or moved between
      categories, and categories are added, changed, or empty categories
      removed, as the Rulekeepor sees fit.
      
      The listing of each rule in the SLR must include the rule's ID
      number, power, title, and text.
      
      The listing of each rule in the SLR must additionally include a
      revision number selected by the Rulekeepor. The Rulekeepor SHOULD
      select revision numbers such that they can be used retrospectively
      to determine that the text of a rule has changed while it
      maintained the same ID number. The Rulekeepor may exercise
      reasonable discretion in calculating revision numbers.
      
      The Rulekeepor is strongly DISCOURAGED from including any
      additional information in the SLR, except that which increases the
      readability of the SLR.
      
      The Full Logical Ruleset (FLR) is a format of the ruleset. In this
      format, rules are assigned to the same category and presented in
      the same order as in the SLR. The FLR must contain all the
      information required to be in the SLR, and any historical
      annotations which the Rulekeepor is required to record.
      
      The Rulekeepor SHOULD also include any other information which e
      feels may be helpful in the use of the ruleset in the FLR.
      
      Whenever a rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeepor SHALL record
      and thereafter maintain a reasonably accurate historical
      annotation to the rule indicating:
      
      1. The type of change.
      
      2. The date on which the change took effect.
      
      3. The mechanism that specified the change.
      
      4. If the rule was changed due to a proposal, then that proposal's
         ID number, author, and coauthor(s) (if any).

Rule 2221/11 (Power=3)
Cleanliness and Tidy Filing

      Any player CAN clean a rule without objection by specifying one or
      more corrections to spelling, grammar, capitalization, formatting,
      and/or dialect, or to whether a synonym or abbreviation is used in
      place of a word or phrase, in the rule's text and/or title; when e
      does so, if any text changes were specified, that rule is amended
      by this rule by applying the changes as a single amendment
      (failing as a whole if any fail); then, if any title changes were
      specified, that rule is retitled by this rule by applying the
      changes as a single retitling (failing as a whole if any fail).
      
      Any player CAN refile a rule without objection, specifying a new
      title; the rule is retitled to the specified title by this rule.
      
      Cleaning rules is secured. Refiling rules is secured.

Rule 2614/9 (Power=3.1)
Eclipse Light

      An emergency message is one whose subject line contains the text
      "[Emergency]".
      
      The Prime Minister CAN, in an emergency message and with 3 Agoran
      consent, enact, amend, or repeal Emergency Regulations, provided
      that the intent to do so was also contained in an emergency
      message. To the extent explicitly permitted by this rule,
      Emergency regulations are always taking effect.
      
      Emergency Regulations CAN, as part of their effect:
        - Extend any deadline provided for by any instrument other than
          this rule, including a deadline for an obligation to be met,
          or deadline prior to which an action must be performed in
          order to be valid, such as the end of voting period. Such an
          extension CANNOT cause the total time period, such as the
          time from when an obligation was created to the deadline or
          the whole of a voting period, to be more than double its
          original length.
        - Create, destroy, or transfer assets, or require or forbid
          their creation, destruction, or transfer.
        - Collectively, exercise Mint Authority
        - Cause one or more players to win Agora.
        - Appoint or remove officeholders, other than Prime Minister or
          Speaker.
        - Modify the Festivity.
        - Award Patent Titles that are either Badges or are not
          mentioned in any Rule.
        - Modify the Publicity of Fora.
      
      The Prime Minister CAN, in an emergency message and with 4 Agoran
      Consent, provided that the intent to do so was also contained in
      an emergency message, Extend the Emergency.
      
      If there is an Emergency Regulation that has existed for at least
      a month and the Prime Minister has not Extended the Emergency in
      the past month, any player CAN, with 7 days notice, cause this
      rule to repeal all Emergency Regulations.
      
      If the Prime Minister has not sent a message to a public forum in
      the preceding four days, the Speaker CAN exercise eir powers under
      this rule as if e were the Prime Minister, and notwithstanding any
      rule that would prohibit a single player from holding both
      offices.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, Emergency Regulations
      CANNOT be enacted, amended, or repealed except as described in
      this Rule.

Rule 693/17 (Power=3)
Agoran Decisions

      When the rules call for an Agoran decision to be made, the
      decision-making process takes place in the following three
      stages, each described elsewhere:
      
      1. Initiation of the decision.
      
      2. Voting of the people.
      
      3. Resolution of the decision.

Rule 107/26 (Power=3)
Initiating Agoran Decisions

      An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
      initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
      to initiate the decision. To be valid, the notice must clearly
      specify the following information:
      
      1. The matter to be decided (for example, "the adoption of
         proposal 4781");
      
      2. The voting method;
      
      3. A clear description of the valid options;
      
      4. The identity of the vote collector; and
      
      5. Any additional information defined by the rules as essential
         parameters.
      
      The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting period
      for the decision. The default length of the voting period is 7
      days. Changing the length of a decision's voting period is secured
      at power 2, and it CANNOT be set or changed to more than 14 days,
      or less than 5 days for a decision with at least two options.
      
      The vote collector for a decision with less than two options CAN
      end the voting period by announcement, if it has not ended
      already, and provided that e resolves the decision in the same
      message.
      
      A public notice purporting to initiate an Agoran decision is a
      self-ratifying attestation that the notice was valid, that the
      person (if any) publishing the notice was authorized to initiate
      the decision, and that such a decision was initiated.
      
      The destruction of an Agoran decision and the causing of an Agoran
      decision to cease being an Agoran decision are secured at the
      power of the Rule authorizing the initiation of such a decision.

Rule 2528/1 (Power=3)
Voting Methods

      Each Agoran decision has a voting method, which must be
      AI-majority, instant runoff, or first-past-the-post. The voting
      method is that specified by the authorizing authority, or
      first-past-the-post by default.
      
      Each Agoran decision has a set of valid options (the choices that
      the voters are being asked to select from) and valid votes (the
      ways in which the voters can express their opinion or lack
      thereof). For AI-majority decisions, the valid options are FOR and
      AGAINST; for other decisions, the valid options are defined by
      other rules.
      
      The valid votes on an Agoran decision are:
      
      1. PRESENT;
      
      2. The valid conditional votes, as defined by rules of power at
         least that of this rule; and
      
      3. For an instant runoff decision, the ordered lists of entities.
      
      4. For any other decision, the valid options.

Rule 683/27 (Power=3)
Voting on Agoran Decisions

      An entity submits a ballot on an Agoran decision by publishing a
      notice satisfying the following conditions:
      
      1. The ballot is submitted during the voting period for the
         decision.
      
      2. The entity casting the ballot (the voter) was, at the
         initiation of the decision, a player.
      
      3. The ballot clearly identifies the matter to be decided.
      
      4. The ballot clearly identifies a valid vote, as determined by
         the voting method.
      
      5. The ballot clearly sets forth the voter's intent to place
         the identified vote.
      
      6. The voter has no other valid ballots on the same decision.
      
      A valid ballot is a ballot, correctly submitted, that has not been
      withdrawn. During the voting period of an Agoran decision, an
      entity CAN by announcement withdraw (syn. retract) a ballot that e
      submitted on that decision. To "change" one's vote is to retract
      eir previous ballot (if any), then submit a new one. Submitting
      and withdrawing ballots is secured.

Rule 208/14 (Power=3)
Resolving Agoran Decisions

      The vote collector for an unresolved Agoran decision CAN resolve
      it by announcement, indicating the outcome. If it was required to
      be initiated, then e SHALL resolve it in a timely fashion after
      the end of the voting period. To be EFFECTIVE, such an attempt
      must satisfy the following conditions:
      
      1. It is published after the voting period has ended.
      
      2. It clearly identifies the matter to be resolved.
      
      3. It specifies the number of voters (or a list of the voters).
         For these purposes and for determining quorum, a "voter" is
         someone who submitted a ballot on the decision that was valid
         when it was submitted and also valid (i.e. not withdrawn or
         otherwise invalidated) at the end of the voting period.
      
      4. It specifies the outcome, as described elsewhere, and, if there
         was more than one valid option, provides a tally of the voters'
         valid ballots.
      
      Each Agoran decision has exactly one vote collector, defaulting to
      the initiator of the decision. If the vote collector is defined by
      reference to a position (or, in the default case, if the initiator
      was so defined), then the vote collector is the current holder of
      that position.
      
      This rule takes precedence over any rule that would provide
      another mechanism by which an Agoran decision may be resolved.
      
      In general, changes to the gamestate due to the outcome of an
      Agoran decision take effect when the decision is resolved.

Rule 955/27 (Power=3)
Determining the Will of Agora

      Each Agoran decision has a voting method, which determines how
      voters may vote on it and how to calculate the outcome. The
      strength of a ballot is the voting strength of the voter who cast
      it on that Agoran decision, as calculated at the end of that
      decision's voting period.
      
      1. For an AI-majority decision, let F be the total strength of all
         valid ballots cast FOR a decision, A be the same for AGAINST,
         and AI be the adoption index of the decision. The outcome is
         ADOPTED if F/A >= AI and F/A > 1 (or F>0 and A=0), otherwise
         REJECTED.
      
      2. For an instant runoff decision, the outcome is whichever option
         wins according to the standard definition of instant runoff.
         For this purpose, a ballot of strength N is treated as if it
         were N distinct ballots expressing the same preferences. In
         case multiple valid options tie for the lowest number of votes
         at any stage, the vote collector CAN and must, in the
         announcement of the decision's resolution, select one such
         option to eliminate; if, for M > 1, all eir possible choices in
         the next M stages would result in the same set of options being
         eliminated, e need not specify the order of elimination. If an
         entity that is part of a valid vote is not a valid option at
         the end of the voting period, or disqualified by the rule
         providing for the decision, then that entity is eliminated
         prior to the first round of counting.
      
      3. For a first-past-the-post decision, the outcome is whichever
         option received the highest total strength of valid ballots. In
         case of a tie, the vote collector CAN and must, in the
         announcement of the decision's resolution, select one of the
         leaders as the outcome.
      
      The previous notwithstanding:
      
      - If there is more than one option, and the number of voters is
        less than the quorum of that decision, the outcome is instead
        FAILED QUORUM.
      
      - If there are no valid options, the outcome is null.
      
      The outcome of a decision is determined when it is resolved, and
      cannot change thereafter.

Rule 879/40 (Power=3)
Quorum

      Each Agoran decision has a quorum. This is a number set when the
      decision is created, and thereafter cannot be changed. When a
      person initiates an Agoran decision, that person SHALL state the
      quorum of that decision. However, incorrectly stating the quorum
      of a decision does not invalidate the initiation, nor does it
      actually change the quorum of the decision.
      
      The quorum that an Agoran decision gains as it is created can be
      defined by other rules of power 2 or greater. If no other rule
      defines the quorum of an Agoran decision, the quorum for that
      decision is equal to 2/3 of the number of voters on the referendum
      that had been most recently resolved at the time of that
      decision's initiation, the whole rounded to the nearest integer.
      
      As an exception to the previous paragraph, the minimum quorum of
      an Agoran decision is 2, or 1 if there are fewer than 2 players in
      the game. If the rules would attempt to set the quorum of an
      Agoran decision to less than the minimum quorum, it is set to the
      minimum instead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2422/8 (Power=3)
Voting Strength

      The voting strength of an entity on an Agoran decision is an
      integer between 0 and 15 inclusive, defined by rules of power 2 or
      greater. If not otherwise specified, the voting strength of an
      entity on an Agoran decision is 3.
      
      When multiple rules set or modify an entity's voting strength on
      an Agoran decision, it shall be determined by first applying the
      rule(s) which set it to a specific value, using the ordinary
      precedence of rules, and then applying the rules, other than this
      one, which modify it, in numerical order by ID. Finally, if the
      result of the calculation is not an integer, it is rounded up, and
      then if it is outside the allowable range of values for voting
      strength, it is set to the minimum value if it was less and the
      maximum value if it was more.

Rule 2127/11 (Power=3)
Conditional Votes

      A conditional vote on an Agoran decision is a vote which indicates
      a vote based on some condition(s). A conditional vote is evaluated
      at the end of the voting period and, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, is clearly specified if and only if the value of
      the condition(s) is/are determinate at the end of the voting
      period. If the conditional is clearly specified, and evaluates to
      a valid vote, it is counted as that vote; otherwise, it is counted
      as PRESENT.
      
      Any vote which is clearly expressed as a conditional, e.g. "FOR if
      <X> is true, AGAINST otherwise", is a valid conditional vote that
      evaluates as specified.
      
      A vote endorsing another person is equivalent to a conditional
      vote evaluating to the vote specified in that person's valid
      ballot on the decision, if any.
      
      For an instant runoff decision, a vote consisting of a list, one
      or more entries of which are valid conditional votes, and the
      remaining entries of which are valid options, is a valid
      conditional vote. Such a vote is evaluated by evaluating each
      conditional entry to a list of votes (or an empty list, if it
      evaluates to PRESENT either directly or indirectly), and then
      concatenating those lists with the specified valid options in the
      order they occurred in the original vote.

Rule 2168/10 (Power=2)
Extending the Voting Period

      Whenever the voting period of an Agoran decision would end, and
      the result would be FAILED QUORUM, the length of the voting period
      for that decision is instead increased to 14 days, except if it is
      already that length, provided this has not already happened for
      the decision in question.
      
      Within four days of such an occurrence, the vote collector for the
      decision SHALL issue a humiliating public reminder naming the
      slackers who have not yet cast any votes on it despite being
      eligible players, and CAN end its voting period by announcement
      (resolving it constitutes an implicit announcement that its voting
      period is first ended) if the result would no longer be FAILED
      QUORUM, or if the decision is a referendum on a proposal and no
      voter (other than possibly the proposal's author) has voted FOR.

Rule 1950/39 (Power=3)
Decisions with Adoption Indices

      Adoption index (AI) is an untracked switch possessed by Agoran
      decisions and proposals, secured at power 2.  For decisions, the
      possible values are "none" (default) or integral multiples of 0.1
      from 1.0 to 9.9. For proposals, the possible values are integral
      multiples of 0.1 from 1.0 to 9.9 (default 1.0). 
      
      The adoption index of a referendum CANNOT be set or changed to
      "none" or to a value less than that of its associated proposal. If
      a referendum ever has an adoption index of "none" or an adoption
      index less than that of its associated proposal, it is immediately
      set to the adoption index of the associated proposal.
      
      Adoption index is an essential parameter of an Agoran decision if
      that decision has an adoption index.
      
      For any Agoran decision with a non-"none" adoption index, the
      voting method is AI-majority.

========================================================================
Offices & Reporting
   Players who hold offices have control over and track various
   different mechanics. These rules govern the special responsibilities
   that officers have.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1006/49 (Power=2)
Offices

      An Office is a position described as an Office by the Rules.
      Officeholder is an office switch tracked by the ADoP, with
      possible values of any person or "vacant" (default). Each instance
      of the Officeholder switch is secured at the power of the Rule
      defining the associated office (or the power of this Rule, if the
      defining Rule's power is higher). An officer is the holder of an
      office, who may be referred to by the name of that office. If the
      holder of an office is ever not a player, it becomes vacant.
      
      Imposed offices and sortitioned offices are offices described as
      such by the rules that define them. All other offices are elected.
      An office is voluntary if and only if it is elected or
      sortitioned. The selection method for a sortitioned office is a
      sortition for that office. The selection method for an elected
      office is an election for that office.
      
      A person CANNOT be made the holder of a voluntary office without
      eir consent. A person voluntarily entering emself into the
      selection method of that office always satisfies this requirement,
      regardless of whether it meets the normal definition of consent.
      
      The holder of a voluntary office CAN resign it by announcement,
      causing it to become vacant. Any player CAN cause a voluntary
      office to become vacant without 2 objections.
      
      The non-interim holder of an elected office CAN, with 3 support,
      resign the office while appointing another player to become the
      holder of the office, provided that other player is one of the
      supporters.
      
      Immediately after a proposal finishes taking effect, if one or
      more offices exist that did not exist prior to the proposal taking
      effect, each such office, if it is vacant, becomes held by the
      author of the proposal.

      properties:
      
      1. An officer SHALL NOT violate requirements in eir office's
         administrative regulations clearly intended to be punishable as
         rules violations in the discharge of eir office.
      2. Any player CAN act on behalf of an officer to exercise eir

Rule 2651/1 (Power=2)
The Election Cycle

      A holder of an elected office who did not become its holder by
      winning an election, and has not won an election for that office
      since, is an interim holder. An elected office that is either
      vacant or has an interim holder is an interim office.
      
      An office is term-limited if the most recent election for that
      office was resolved more than the length of that office's term
      prior. The term for the office of Prime Minister is 90 days. The
      term for all other elected offices is 180 days.
      
      A player CAN initiate an election for a specified elected office:
      
      a) With 2 support (if the office is either interim or term-
      limited) or 4 support (otherwise), and provided that the initiator
      becomes a candidate in the same message.
      
      b) By announcement, if e is the ADoP (or, if the office is the
      ADoP, if e is the Assessor) and the office is interim, or if e is
      the holder of that office.
      
      Once per quarter, the ADoP CAN and SHALL publish a Notice of
      Election specifying between 2-4 term-limited offices (if there
      fewer than 2 term-limited offices, the ADoP MUST instead list all
      of them).  Such a notice initiates elections for the specified
      offices.  The ADoP SHOULD prioritize offices that have gone
      longest since their last elections.
      
      The above notwithstanding, an election for an office CANNOT be
      initiated if one is already in progress.

Rule 2154/61 (Power=2)
Election Procedure

      When an election is initiated, it enters the nomination period,
      which lasts for 4 days. After an election is initiated and until
      nominations close, any player CAN become a candidate by
      announcement. A candidate ceases to be a candidate if e ceases to
      be a player during the election or if holding the office would
      make em Overpowered. During the nomination period, a candidate CAN
      cease to be a candidate by announcement if there is at least one
      other candidate.
      
      Each candidate in an election is ENCOURAGED to campaign by
      indicating why e would be the best choice, and (if applicable) how
      e would run the office differently than the previous holder.  The
      ADoP SHOULD remind candidates to campaign.
      
      An election whose nomination period is complete is contested if it
      has two or more candidates, and uncontested otherwise. Nominations
      close at the end of the poll's voting period or when the election
      is ended, whichever comes first.
      
      After the nomination period ends, the ADoP (or, if the office is
      the ADoP, the Assessor) CAN and, in a timely fashion, SHALL:
      
      1) If the election is contested, initiate an Agoran decision to
         select the winner of the election (the poll). For this
         decision, the Vote Collector is the ADoP (or, if the office is
         the ADoP, the Assessor), the valid options are the candidates
         for that election (including those who become candidates after
         its initiation), and the voting method is instant runoff. When
         the poll is resolved, its outcome, if a player, wins the
         election. If the outcome is not a player, the election ends
         with no winner.
      
      2) If POSSIBLE per the following paragraph, end the election
         immediately.
      
      If at any point an uncontested election has a single candidate,
      then any player CAN by announcement declare em the winner of the
      election, thereby causing em to win the election. If at any point
      an uncontested election has no candidates, then any player CAN
      declare the election ended with no winner by announcement.
      
      When a player wins an election, e is installed into the associated
      office and the election ends.

Rule 2160/27 (Power=3)
Deputisation

      A player acting as emself (the deputy) CAN perform an action
      ordinarily reserved for an office-holder as if e held the office
      if all of the following are true:
      
       1) The rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of
          holding that office, to perform the action. (This requirement
          is fulfilled by the deputy performing the action.)
      
       2) It would be POSSIBLE for the deputy to perform the action,
          other than by deputisation, if e held the office.
      
       3) The deputy, when performing the action, announces that e is
          doing so by deputisation or by temporary deputisation.
      
       4) The deputy has not held the office in the past 7 days.
      
      (If the office is vacant, then the remaining items in this list
      need not be true.)
      
       5) A time limit by which the rules require the action to be
          performed has expired.
      
       6) The office's holder has not changed in the past 7 days.
      
       7) Any of the following are true:
      
          a) The deputy announced between 2 and 14 days earlier that
             e intended to deputise for that office for the purposes of
             the particular action.
      
          b) The time limit expired between 14 and 28 days ago.
      
          c) The time limit expired more than 28 days ago, and the
             deputisation is temporary.
      
      When a player deputises for a voluntary office, e becomes the
      holder of that office, unless the deputisation is temporary, doing
      so would make em Overpowered, and/or the action being performed
      would already install someone into that office.

Rule 2689/2 (Power=3.0)
Vacations & Delegation

      Delegate is an Office switch with possible values of "None" and
      any active player, and default value of "None". Delegates are
      tracked by the ADoP in eir weekly report.
      
      A player CAN flip the Delegate switch of a specified office to
      emself with Agoran Consent. If the Delegate switch of an office is
      set to "None", the holder of that office CAN flip the Delegate
      switch of that office to a specified player with support from that
      specified player.
      
      An officer CAN and SHOULD take a Vacation from a specified office
      e has continuously held for over 6 months with 7 day notice, if e
      has not done so in the past year. When an officer qualifies for a
      Vacation, the ADoP SHOULD encourage em to take one, at least once
      a quarter.
      
      An officer is On Vacation from a specified office if e has taken a
      Vacation from that office in the past 30 days. The list of
      officers currently on vacation is part of the ADoP's report.
      
      While the holder of an office is On Vacation, the Delegate of that
      office CAN perform an action ordinarily reserved for the
      office-holder as if e held the office, if it would be POSSIBLE for
      the Delegate to perform the action, other than by this method, if
      e held the office.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, while an officer is On
      Vacation that officer NEED NOT comply with any duties of that
      office, and the Delegate, if any, SHALL comply with all duties of
      the office as if e held the office.
      
      The Delegate of an office CANNOT resign it. The Delegate of an
      office, if any, and the holder of that office, if any, CAN by
      announcement flip the Delegate of that office to "None".

Rule 2691/3 (Power=2.0)
Sortition Procedure

      A player CAN by announcement initiate a sortition for a vacant
      sortitioned office for which a sortition is not ongoing. At the
      beginning of each quarter, for each sortitioned office for which a
      sortition is not ongoing, the ADoP CAN once by announcement, and
      SHALL in a timely fashion, initiate a sortition.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a sortition CANNOT be
      initiated for an office for which a sortition is ongoing.
      
      When a sortition is initiated, it enters the lots period. Any
      player CAN by announcement become an option for that office during
      this period. If a person ceases to be a player during this period,
      e also ceases to be an option for each current sortition.
      
      Seven days after a sortition is initiated, its lots period ends.
      The ADoP CAN by announcement, and SHALL in a timely fashion after
      a lots period ends, randomly select one of the options for that
      office. When e does so, that player becomes the officeholder for
      that office, then the sortition ends.
      
      If a sortition's lots period has ended, and the sortition has no
      valid options, then it immediately ends with no selection, and any
      duty to select an option with respect to it is discharged.
      
      If a sortition is ever ongoing for a non-sortitioned office (or
      for an office that no longer exists), that sortition immediately
      ends.

      or monthly duties respectively include publishing a document or
      series of documents, labelled as that office's report (or as that
      office's weekly or monthly report as appropriate), that includes
      all such information.
      
      Any information defined by the rules as part of a person's report,
      without specifying which one, is part of eir weekly report.
      Failure of a person to perform any weekly duty required of em

Complexity

      Complexity is a secured office switch reflecting how complex it is
      to fulfill the duties of its office. Its possible values are all
      integers from 0 to 3 inclusive, where 1 is the default. It is
      tracked in the ADoP's weekly report. The ADoP CAN, with 2 Agoran
      consent, flip the complexity of an office to a specified possible
      value.
      
      For each office a player holds, eir voting strength is increased
      by the complexity of the office for referenda on ordinary
      proposals, up to a maximum increase of 3 by this method.

Recordkeepors

      For some entity or class of entities to be "tracked by" another
      entity is for the latter entity to be its recordkeepor.
      
      For an entity to be a recordkeepor for a type of switch is for
      that entity to be the recordkeepor for all instances of that
      switch.
      
      Where the rules specify a recordkeepor for some set of instances
      of a switch, that recordkeepor's (weekly, if not specified
      otherwise) report includes the value of each instance in that set
      whose value is not its default value; a public document purporting
      to be this portion of that recordkeepor's report is
      self-ratifying, and implies that other instances in that set are
      at their default value.
      
      The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity (if any)
      defined as such by, and bound by, its backing document. That
      recordkeepor's report includes a list of all instances of that

Documents
   Documents are little bits of text that can be ratified, therefore
   modifying the gamestate slightly.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1551/23 (Power=3.2)
Ratification

      A retroactive change is one that changes the game's record of past
      events. Retroactive changes are secured with power threshold 3.
      
      When a document or statement (hereafter "document") is to be
      ratified, the following definitions apply:
      * The publication time can be specified by the instrument allowing
        the ratification, defaulting to the instant at which the
        document to be ratified was published.
      * The truth time is the instant at which the document specifies
        that it was true, or the publication time if such an instant is
        not specified.
      * The application time is the instant at which the document to be
        ratified is ratified.
      
      Ratification CANNOT occur if the truth time would be after the
      application time, or if the publication time would be after the
      application time.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, when a document is
      ratified, the gamestate is modified to what it would be if, at the
      truth time, the gamestate had been minimally modified to make the
      ratified document as true and accurate as possible.
      
      Ratification CANNOT occur if it would add inconsistencies between
      the gamestate and the rules.
      
      Ratification CANNOT occur if the required modification to the
      gamestate is not possible or if multiple substantially distinct
      possible modifications would be equally appropriate.
      
      If the minimal modification would include past or present rule
      changes, they are instead excluded unless the ratified document
      explicitly and unambiguously recites either the changes or the
      resulting properties of the rule(s).
      
      An internally inconsistent document generally CANNOT be ratified;
      however, if such a document can be divided into a summary section
      and a main section, where the only purpose of the summary section
      is to summarize information in the main section, and the main
      section is internally consistent, ratification of the document
      proceeds as if it contained only the main section.
      
      Text purportedly about previous instances of ratification (e.g. a
      report's date of last ratification) is excluded from ratification.
      The rules may define additional information that is considered to
      be part of the document for the purposes of ratification; such
      definitions are secured with power threshold 3.
      
      Ratification is secured with power threshold 3.

      document.
      
      Ratification Without Objection CANNOT cause the repeal, amendment,

      notwithstanding.
      
      A player SHALL NOT knowingly use or announce intent to use
      Ratification Without Objection to ratify a (prior to ratification)
      document containing incorrect or Indeterminate information when a

      unless the general nature of the document's error and reason for
      ratifying it is clearly and plainly described in the announcement
      of intent. Such ratification or announcement of intent to ratify
      is the Class 8 Infraction of Endorsing Forgery.

Rule 2201/14 (Power=3)
Self-Ratification

      When a public document published less than 180 days ago is first
      continuously undoubted for two weeks after publication:
      
      - If the rules define it as self-ratifying, it is ratified.
      
      - If the rules define it as a self-ratifying attestation to a
        given statement, the statement is ratified, with the publication
        time being the instant at which the document was published.
      
        This clause is inapplicable if the statement to be ratified
        cannot be reasonably ascertained from the ruleset and the
        contents of the message.
      
      Any person CAN by announcement issue a doubt (syn. claim of
      error), identifying a public document published less than 180 days
      ago and explaining the scope and nature of a perceived error in it
      (or in a statement it attests to).
      
      The definition of documents as self-ratifying and the definition
      of documents as self-ratifying attestations are secured at power
      3.
      
      When this happens, the publisher of the original document SHALL
      (if e was required to publish that document) or SHOULD (otherwise)
      do one of the following in a timely fashion, in an announcement
      that clearly cites the claim of error:
      
         1. Deny the claim (causing it to cease to be a doubt).
      
         2. Publish a revision.
      
         3. Initiate an inquiry case regarding the truth of the claim
            (if the subject is actually a matter of law), or cite a
            relevant existing inquiry case.
      
      The issuance of a doubt on a documents, the denial of a claim of
      error, and the ceasing of a doubt on a document to be a doubt are
      secured at power 3.

Rule 2555/17 (Power=2)
Blots

      Blots are an indestructible fixed currency with ownership
      restricted to persons. A person with 1 or more blots is Impure, a
      person with 0 blots is Pure. An impure unregistered person is a
      Fugitive. The Referee is an office, and the recordkeepor for
      blots.
      
      To expunge a blot is to destroy it. Creating and destroying blots
      is secured with a Power Threshold of 1.7
      
      A person CAN, by announcement, create a specified number of blots
      in eir possession.
      
      Any player CAN pay a fee of 7 Spendies to revoke a blot from a
      specified person.
      
      Once a quarter, the Referee CAN (and SHALL during its first
      Eastman week) publish a Notice of Clemency, upon which half
      (rounded down) of each fugitive's blots are destroyed.

Rule 2478/29 (Power=1.7)
Justice

      An Infraction is a violation of a rule. The person who committed
      an infraction is its infracter.
      
      The Investigator for an infraction is the Referee unless e is the
      infracter. Otherwise, it is the Arbitor.
      
      The Class of an infraction is 2 unless a rule specifies a
      different Class for it.
      
      The Base of an infraction is N, where N is the number of
      previously-investigated, unforgiven infractions that have been
      committed by the same person in the past 30 days. The previous
      notwithstanding, if the base of an infraction would be greater
      than its class, the infraction's base is equal to its class.
      
      Within 14 days of an infraction being committed, or if the
      infraction has been noted in the past 60 days, the Investigator
      CAN investigate the infraction by announcement, specifying a
      number of blots between the Base and the Class of the infraction,
      inclusive. When e does so, that many blots are created in the
      possession of the infracter.
      
      The previous notwithstanding, an Investigator CANNOT investigate
      an infraction that has already been investigated or forgiven. The
      Investigator of a noted, unforgiven infraction SHALL investigate
      the infraction in a timely fashion after it has been noted;
      failure to do so is the Class N infraction of Favoritism, where N
      is equal to the Class of the noted infraction.
      
      A player CAN, by announcement, "note" an unforgiven infraction
      committed by any other player in the past 14 days, specifying the
      incident and the rule it violates (or name of the Infraction if
      it has one); but a player CANNOT note an infraction that has
      already been investigated.
      
      The Referee's weekly report contains a list of noted and
      investigated Infractions committed in the previous week.

Rule 2676/2 (Power=1.7)
Forgiveness

      All infractions that have not been forgiven are unforgiven.
      
      Any player CAN, with Agoran Consent, "forgive" an unforgiven
      infraction that occurred in the past 30 days. When an infraction
      is forgiven, if the infraction was investigated, a number of
      blots in the possession of the infracter equal to the number of
      blots specified by the investigation are destroyed or, if e has
      less blots than specified, all eir blots are destroyed. The
      previous notwithstanding, a player cannot forgive or support an
      intent to forgive eir own infraction.

      An infraction is automatically forgiven if:
      
      (1) the alleged infracter can't be established by a preponderance
          of the evidence to have committed the infraction;
      
      (2) at the time the alleged infraction occurred, it was not an

          infracter, through no fault of eir own, COULD NOT have
          performed;
      
      (4) the infraction is for conduct that the infracter, through no

          or greater power to the one e violated;
      
      (5) the infracter could not have avoided the infraction when

========================================================================
Calls for Judgement
   What if there is a rule conflict? What if we can't decide what a rule
   means? Well then, it's time to call a CFJ.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 991/35 (Power=2)
Calls for Judgement

      Any person (the initiator) can initiate a Call for Judgement (CFJ,
      syn. Judicial Case), specifying a statement to be inquired into by
      announcement. A case so initiated is an inquiry case.
      
      When a person initiates a Call for Judgement, e CAN optionally bar
      one person from the case by announcement.
      
      At any time, each CFJ is either open (default), suspended, or
      assigned exactly one judgement that was validly assigned.
      
      The Arbitor is an office, responsible for the administration of
      justice in a manner that is fair for emself, if not for the rest
      of Agora.
      
      Judge is an untracked CFJ switch with possible values of any
      person or former person, or "unassigned" (default). To "assign" a
      CFJ to a person is to flip that CFJ's judge to that person.  To
      "remove" or "recuse" a person from a being the judge of a CFJ is
      to flip that CFJ's judge from that person to unassigned.
      
      When an open CFJ's judge is unassigned, the Arbitor CAN assign any
      eligible player to be its judge by announcement, and SHALL do so
      in a timely fashion after it becomes an open and unassigned CFJ.
      The players eligible to be assigned as judge are all active
      players except the initiator and the person barred (if any). The
      Arbitor SHALL assign judges over time such that all interested
      players have reasonably equal opportunities to judge.  If a CFJ
      has no judge assigned, then any player eligible to judge that CFJ
      CAN assign it to emself without 3 objections.
      
      The Arbitor's weekly report includes a summary of recent judicial
      case activity, including open and recently-judged cases, recent
      judicial assignments, and a list of players interested in judging.
      
      If two CFJs become assigned to the same judge in the same message,
      those CFJs are "linked" to each other, unless that message
      specifies that the CFJs should not be linked. The Arbitor SHOULD
      consider linking two CFJs if they inquire about the same or
      substantially similar events and are called at approximately the
      same time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 591/51 (Power=1.7)
Delivering Judgements

      When a CFJ is open and assigned to a judge, that judge CAN assign
      a valid judgement to it by announcement, and SHALL do so in an
      officially timely fashion after this becomes possible.
      
      The valid judgements for an inquiry case are as follows, based on
      the facts and legal situation at the time the inquiry case was
      initiated, not taking into account any events since that time:
      
      * FALSE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
        logically false.
      
      * TRUE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
        logically true.
      
      * IRRELEVANT, appropriate if the veracity of the statement is
        not relevant to the game or is an overly hypothetical
        extrapolation of the game or its rules to conditions that don't
        actually exist, or if it can be trivially determined from the
        outcome of another (possibly still undecided) judicial case that
        was not itself judged IRRELEVANT.
      
      * INSUFFICIENT, appropriate if the statement does not come
        with supporting arguments or evidence, and the judge feels as if
        an undue burden is being placed on em by the lack of arguments
        and evidence. A CFJ judged as INSUFFICIENT SHOULD be submitted
        again with sufficient arguments/evidence.
      
      * DISMISS, appropriate if the statement is malformed, undecidable,
        if insufficient information exists to make a judgement with
        reasonable effort, or the statement is otherwise not able to be
        answered with another valid judgement. DISMISS is not
        appropriate if PARADOXICAL is appropriate.
      
      * PARADOXICAL, appropriate if the statement is logically
        undecidable as a result of a paradox or or other irresolvable
        logical situation. PARADOXICAL is not appropriate if IRRELEVANT
        is appropriate, nor is it appropriate if the undecidability
        arises from the case itself or in reference to it.
      
      If the judge of an open CFJ has not violated a time limit for
      assigning it a judgement, and has not previously filed a motion to
      either extend or reconsider the case, e CAN file a motion to
      extend the case by announcement. Doing so extends eir judgement
      deadline for that case by one week. In doing so, e SHOULD include
      a (nonbinding) draft or outline of eir current thoughts on the
      case.

Annotations:
CFJ 1835 (called 18 Dec 2007): A question cannot generally take the
    place of a statement in initiating an inquiry case.
CFJ 1903 (called 06 Feb 2008): The question-statement equivalence
    established by this rule applies only for the purposes of the
    subject of an inquiry case, not for acting by announcement.
CFJ 1671 (called 17 May 2007): The truth or falsity of a statement can
    be determined as of the initiation of a CFJ even if public knowledge
    at the time of initiation was not sufficient to determine it.
CFJ 1482 (called 10 Feb 2004): If the truth of a CFJ statement logically
    depends on the truth of statements of a previously-called CFJ which
    has not yet been judged, the judge is entitled to treat this as a
    situation of insufficient information being available.
CFJ 1744 (called 18 Sep 2007): It is not the job of the judge to hunt
    down or request the information that would be required to render a
    substantive judgement.
CFJ 1771 (called 28 Oct 2007): If an inquiry case revolves around the
    interpretation of a specific message, and the initiator does not
    provide a reasonable reference to that message , the judge is
    entitled to treat this as a situation of insufficient information
    being available.
CFJ 1732 (called 23 Aug 2007): If a particular player holds a particular
    office, and an inquiry case on a statement that that player holds
    that office is judged FALSE, that player still holds that office.
CFJ 2281 (called 19 Nov 2008): For the purposes of determining the
    validity of an inquiry case, the term "statement" should be
    interpreted loosely.
CFJ 3837 (called 24 May 2020): A statement formed from the logical
    combination of a proposition that has no bearing on the game and one
    that does is IRRELEVANT.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 911/56 (Power=1.7)
Motions and Moots

      The judge of a CFJ CAN by announcement self-file a Motion to
      Reconsider it, if its most recent judgement has been in effect for
      less than seven days.
      
      Any player CAN with 2 support group-file a Motion to Reconsider a
      case, if its most recent judgement had been in effect for less
      than seven days at the time the intent was tabled.
      
      The above notwithstanding, it is IMPOSSIBLE to file a Motion to
      Reconsider a CFJ whose current judgement has been entered into
      Moot, or that has already had a Motion to Reconsider filed against
      it by the same method since it was most recently assigned to a
      judge.
      
      When a Motion to Reconsider a case is filed, the case is rendered
      open again.
      
      If a CFJ has a judgement assigned, a player CAN enter that
      judgement into Moot with N+2 support, where N is the number of
      weeks from the time the judgement was assigned to the time the
      intent was tabled, rounded down. When this occurs, the CFJ is
      suspended, and the Arbitor is once authorized to initiate the
      Agoran decision to determine public confidence in the judgement,
      which e SHALL do in a timely fashion.
      
      For this decision, the vote collector is the Arbitor and the valid
      options are AFFIRM, REMAND, and REMIT. When the decision is
      resolved, the effect depends on the outcome:
      
      - AFFIRM, FAILED QUORUM: The judgement is reassigned to the case,
        and cannot be entered into Moot again.
      
      - REMAND: The case becomes open again.
      
      - REMIT: The case becomes open again, and the current judge is
        recused. The Arbitor SHALL NOT assign em to the case again
        unless no other eligible judges have displayed interest in
        judging.

Rule 2175/9 (Power=1)
Judicial Retraction and Excess

      A new case is a judicial case that has not had any judge assigned
      to it. The initiator of a new case CAN retract it by announcement,
      thus causing it to cease to be a judicial case.
      
      An excess case is a new case whose initiator previously initiated
      five or more cases during the same week as that case. A person
      SHALL NOT initiate an excess case. The Arbitor CAN refuse an
      excess case by announcement, thus causing it to cease to be a
      judicial case. When e does so, e fulfills any obligations with
      regards to that case.

      The Arbitor CAN recuse a judge from a case by announcement, if

Submitting a CFJ to the Referee

      When a person initiates a Call for Judgement, e CAN, optionally,
      submit it to the Referee by announcement. All persons are
      ENCOURAGED to submit a case to the Referee only when there is a
      good reason not to let it be processed by the Arbitor as usual.

      obligations and powers, other than obligations to report, for that
      case that the Arbitor would otherwise receive due to being
      Arbitor. This rule takes precedence over Rules that would
      otherwise assign duties and powers regarding to a judicial case to
      the Arbitor.

Rule 2471/4 (Power=1)
No Faking

      A person SHALL NOT make a public statement that is a lie.
      
      A public statement is falsy if any of the following was true at
      the time of publication:
      * The statement was not true and the author knew or should have
        known that it was not true.
      * The author did not believe the statement to be true.
      
      A public statement is a lie if it is falsy and any of the
      following is true:
      * The author made the statement with intent to mislead.
      * The author, in the same message, declared the statement to be
        made "under penalty of No Faking" (or similar).
      
      For the purposes of this rule, an attempt to perform an action by
      publishing certain text constitutes an implicit statement that the
      action was EFFECTIVE.
      
      Merely quoting a statement or attempt does not constitute making
      it for the purposes of this rule. Any disclaimer, conditional
      clause, or other qualifier attached to a statement or attempt
      constitutes part of the statement or attempt for the purposes of
      this rule; the truth or falsity of the whole is what is
      significant.
      
      The above notwithstanding, a formal announcement of intent is
      never a lie.

Rule 2450/12 (Power=1.7)
Pledges

      If a consenting Player makes a clear public pledge (syn. Oath) to
      perform (or refrain from performing) certain actions, then
      breaking the pledge is ILLEGAL; doing so is the Class N infraction
      of Oathbreaking, where N is the value explicitly stated by the
      pledge, or 2 if the pledge does not explicitly state a value.
      Allowing a pledge to expire without carrying out an action one
      pledged to do in it constitutes breaking the pledge. If it would
      otherwise be indeterminate whether a player has violated a pledge,
      then e shall be deemed to have violated that pledge.
      
      The time window of a pledge is W days, where W is the value
      explicitly stated by the pledge, or 60 if the pledge does not
      explicitly state a value. A pledge ceases to exist at the end of
      its time window.
      
      If breaking the pledge harms specific other parties, the Referee
      SHOULD solicit the opinion of those parties in determining an
      appropriate fine.
      
      The Notary CAN destroy a pledge Without Objection, but SHOULD NOT
      do so unless the pledge no longer serves any significant purpose.

Rule 2466/3 (Power=3)
Acting on Behalf

      When a rule allows one person (the agent) to act on behalf of
      another (the principal) to perform an action, that agent CAN
      perform the action if it is POSSIBLE for the principal to do so,
      taking into account any prerequisites for the action. If the
      enabling rule does not specify the mechanism by which the agent
      may do so, then the agent CAN perform the action in the same
      manner in which the principal CAN do so, with the additional
      requirement that the agent must, in the message in which the
      action is performed, uniquely identify the principal and that the
      action is being taken on behalf of that person.
      
      A person SHALL NOT act on behalf of another person if doing so
      causes the second person to violate the rules. A person CANNOT act
      on behalf of another person to do anything except perform a game
      action; in particular, a person CANNOT act on behalf of another
      person to send a message, only to perform specific actions that
      might be taken within a message, including actions that would
      otherwise be taken by publishing certain text.
      
      When an action is performed on behalf of a principal, then the
      action is considered for all game purposes to have been performed
      by the principal, unless a rule specifically states that it is
      treated differently for some purpose, in which case it is treated
      as described by that rule.
      
      Allowing a person to act on behalf of another person is secured at
      power 2.0. This rule takes precedence over any rule that would
      prohibit a person from taking an action, except that it defers to
      any rule that imposes limitations specifically on actions taken on
      behalf of another person.
      
      An agent CANNOT act on behalf of a principal to perform an action
      via a specific method if the rules state that the actor acts "as
      emself" or "on eir own behalf" to perform the action via that
      method.

Rule 2618/7 (Power=2.2)
Promises

      Promises are a class of assets, tracked by the Notary. Their
      essential attributes are their text and creator. A consenting
      player CAN, by announcement, grant a specified entity a promise,
      specifying its text and becoming its creator. A promise's owner is
      referred to as its bearer. Promises with the same text, creator,
      and bearer are fungible. Promises with the same text and creator
      SHOULD be referred to by the same title, but the title is not an
      essential attribute of the promise, just a way of referring to it.
      
      The creation of promises is secured. The text of a promise CANNOT
      be altered after it is created.
      
      A player (the casher) CAN, by announcement, cash a promise,
      provided that both a) any conditions for cashing it specified by
      its text are unambiguously met, and b) either the casher is the
      promise's bearer, or the promise is owned by the Library. By doing
      so, e acts on the creator of the promise's behalf, causing the
      creator to act as if e published the promise's text, and destroys
      the promise.  However, to limit recursion, no promise can be
      cashed during the execution of another promise unless it existed
      before the execution of that promise began. The bearer SHOULD
      recite the promise's essential attributes in the same message e
      cashes it.
      
      In a promise's text, "the bearer" and "the casher" (or the like)
      both refer to the player who cashed the promise, and "this
      promise" (or the like) refers to the promise. The text of the
      promise can refer to the context of the message in which it is
      cashed, but the context of the message does not otherwise change
      the meaning of the promise.
      
      The Library is an entity and CAN own promises.
      
      The creator of a promise CAN take or revoke it from the Library by
      announcement, unless the promise's text unambiguously designates
      it as irrevocable. Any player CAN revoke a specified promise from
      the Library without objection. If a promise specifies expiration
      conditions then any player CAN by announcement destroy it while
      the expiration conditions are unambiguously met.

Rule 1742/23 (Power=2.5)
Contracts

      Any group of one or more consenting persons (the parties) may
      publicly make an agreement among themselves with the intention
      that it be binding upon them and be governed by the rules. Such
      an agreement is known as a contract. A contract may be modified,
      including by changing the set of parties, with the consent of all
      existing parties. A contract may also be terminated with the
      consent of all parties. A contract automatically terminates if the
      number of parties to it falls below one. It is IMPOSSIBLE for a
      person to become a party to a contract without eir consent.
      
      Parties to a contract governed by the rules SHALL act in
      accordance with that contract. This obligation is not impaired
      by contradiction between the contract and any other contract, or
      between the contract and the rules.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any change that would cause
      the full provisions or parties of a contract to become publicly
      unavailable is canceled and does not take effect.
      
      The portion of a contract's provisions that can be interpreted
      with reference only to information that is either publicly or
      generally available are known as its body; the remainder of the
      provisions are known as the annex.
      
      A party to a contract CAN perform any of the following actions as
      explicitly and unambiguously permitted by the contract's body:
      
      * Act on behalf of another party to the contract.
      
      * By announcement, revoke destructible assets from the contract.
      
      * By announcement, transfer liquid assets from the contract to a
        specified recipient.
      
      Any player CAN cause a contract to be terminated (syn. "shred")
      without 2 objections. This SHOULD only be done to remove unused
      contracts or contracts deemed detrimental to the game as a whole.

Rule 2166/32 (Power=3)
Assets

      An asset is an entity defined as such by a document that has been
      granted Mint Authority by the Rules (hereafter the asset's backing
      document), and existing solely because its backing document
      defines its existence. An asset's backing document can generally
      specify when and how that asset is created, destroyed, and
      transferred.
      
      The rules collectively have Mint Authority. Contracts have Mint
      Authority. An asset defined by rule or regulation is public; any
      other asset is private.

Rule 2576/4 (Power=3)
Ownership

      Each asset has exactly one owner.
      
      An asset CANNOT be gained by or transferred to an entity unless
      its backing document specifies that entity can own it. If an
      asset's backing document is otherwise silent on which entities can
      own it, then it can be owned by Agora, players, and contracts.
      
      An asset "in abeyance" is one whose owner is nonexistent,
      indeterminate, or invalid. If an asset would otherwise be in
      abeyance, then it is owned by the Lost and Found Department (if
      possible) or destroyed (otherwise), subject to modification by its
      backing document (provided that the modification either destroys
      it or prevents it from being in abeyance). Rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the Lost and Found Department can own assets of
      every type. Assets owned by the Lost and Found Department can be
      transferred or destroyed by any player without objection.

Rule 2577/8 (Power=3)
Asset Actions

      An asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner by announcement,
      subject to modification by its backing document. Attempts to
      destroy no assets are successful. An indestructible asset is one
      defined as such by its backing document, and CANNOT be destroyed
      except as explicitly specified by its backing document; any other
      asset is destructible.
      
      For an entity to gain (historical syn. earn) an asset is for that
      asset to be created in that entity's possession. To grant an
      entity an asset is to create it in eir possession. To grant an
      entity a set of assets is to create each asset in the set in eir
      possession.
      
      For an entity to lose an asset is for that asset to be destroyed
      from that entity's possession. To revoke an asset from an entity
      is to destroy it from that entity's possession.
      
      For entity A to take an asset from entity B is to transfer it from
      entity B to entity A.
      
      An asset generally CAN be transferred (syn. given) by announcement
      by its owner to another entity, subject to modification by its
      backing document. Attempts to transfer no assets are successful. A
      fixed asset is one defined as such by its backing document, and
      CANNOT be transferred except as explicitly specified by its
      backing document; any other asset is liquid.
      
      When a rule indicates creating, destroying, or transferring an
      amount of assets that is not a natural number, the specified
      amount is rounded up to the nearest natural number after all other
      calculations.

Rule 2579/4 (Power=3)
Fee-based Actions

      If the Rules associate payment of a set of assets (hereafter the
      fee for the action; syns: cost, price, charge) with performing an
      action, that method for performing that action is a fee-based
      method.
      
      If the fee is a non-integer quantity of a currency, the actual fee
      is the next highest integer amount of that asset.
      
      To use a fee-based method, an entity (the Actor) who is otherwise
      permitted to perform the action must announce that e is performing
      the action; the announcement must specify the correct set of
      assets for the fee and indicate intent to pay that fee for the
      sole purpose of using that method to perform that action.
      
      Upon such an announcement:
      
        - If the Rules specify a recipient for the fee, and the Actor
          CAN transfer that specified fee from emself to the recipient,
          then that fee is transferred from the Actor to the recipient
          and the action is performed simultaneously;
      
        - If the Rules do not specify a recipient, and the Actor CAN
          destroy the specified fee in eir possession, then that fee in
          eir possession is destroyed and the action is performed
          simultaneously.
      
        - Otherwise, no changes are made to asset holdings and the
          action is not performed.

      in eir weekly report.
      
      For each person there is a corresponding type of stamp. Stamps of
      any given type are fungible.
      
      Any player CAN, once per week, pay X stamps, where each specified
      stamp is a different type, to gain (X-1)*3 radiance.
      
      Any player CAN, once per week, pay X Stamps, where each Stamp is
      the same type, to gain (X-1)*2 radiance.
      
      Any active player CAN win by paying N Stamps, where N is the
      current number of active players and each specified Stamp is of a
      different type.
      
      Any player CAN pay a fee of 5 Spendies to grant emself X stamps of

Stamp Scamp

      A rare stamp is a stamp that is the only one of its type that
      exists.
      
      Stamp scamp is a singleton switch tracked by the Collector with
      possible values of each player and null (default). Upon a correct
      announcement that a specified player owns more rare stamps than
      any other player, the stamp scamp switch is flipped to that
      player.
      
      If no person has done so by this mechanism in this quarter, the
      value of the stamp scamp switch, if a player, CAN by announcement
      cause another specified player to gain one stamp of that player's
      type.

Radiance

      The Illuminator is an office, responsible for tracking radiance.
      
      A player's Radiance is an integer player switch defaulting to 0,

   Even if it's not a win, there are still a good few opportunities to

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2438/36 (Power=3)
Ribbons

      The Tailor is an office, and the recordkeepor of Ribbons.
      
      For each type of Ribbon, <type> Ribbon Ownership is a secured
      negative boolean person switch, tracked by the Tailor in eir
      monthly report. Laudability is a secured person switch with
      non-negative integer possible values, defaulting to 0, tracked by
      the Tailor as part of eir monthly report. When a person owns more
      types of ribbons than eir Laudability, eir Laudability is set to
      the number of types of ribbons e owns.
      
      To "award a person a <Ribbon type>" is to flip that person's
      <that type> Ribbon Ownership to True. A person "owns a <Ribbon
      type>" if eir <that type> Ribbon Ownership is True.
      
      A person qualifies for a type of Ribbon if e has earned that type
      of Ribbon within the preceding 7 days (including earlier in the
      same message).
      
      While a person owns all types of Ribbon, that person can Raise a
      Banner by announcement. This causes that person to win the game.
      When a person wins this way, for each type of Ribbon, that
      person's <type> Ribbon Ownership is flipped to False.
      
      The types of Ribbon, and the methods of obtaining them, are as
      follows:
      
      Red (R): When a proposal is adopted and changes at least one rule
      that, immediately before or after the change, has Power >= 3, its
      proposer earns a Red Ribbon.
      
      Orange (O): When a proposal is adopted via a referendum on which
      no valid ballots were AGAINST (after evaluating conditionals), its
      proposer earns an Orange Ribbon.
      
      Green (G): While a person holds a voluntary office, has done so
      continuously for the past 30 days, and has not failed to perform
      any duties of that office within the appropriate time limits
      during those 30 days, that person qualifies for a Green Ribbon.
      
      Emerald (E): When a person wins an election, e earns an Emerald
      Ribbon.
      
      Cyan (C): When a person deputises for an office or is the delegate
      for an office while its holder is on vacation, and that person has
      not held or deputised for that office within the past 7 days, that
      person earns a Cyan Ribbon.
      
      Blue (B): When a person assigns a judgement to a CFJ, and has
      never violated a time limit to assign a judgement to that CFJ,
      nor ever self-filed a motion to reconsider that CFJ, that person
      earns a Blue Ribbon.
      
      Magenta (M): When, during Agora's Birthday, a person publicly
      acknowledges it, that person earns a Magenta Ribbon.
      
      Ultraviolet (U): When a person is awarded the Patent Title
      Champion, that person earns an Ultraviolet Ribbon, unless the
      Champion title was awarded as the result of winning the game via
      this rule.
      
      Violet (V): When a person is awarded a Patent Title other than
      Champion or a degree, that person earns a Violet Ribbon.
      
      Indigo (I): When a person is awarded a degree, that person earns
      an Indigo Ribbon.
      
      Platinum (P): The Speaker qualifies for a Platinum Ribbon.
      
      Lime (L): A person qualifies for a Lime Ribbon if three or more
      proposals adopted in the preceding 7 days had that person as a
      coauthor.
      
      White (W): A player qualifies for a White Ribbon if e has never
      previously owned a White Ribbon (including under previous
      rulesets). A player who has been registered for the past 30+ days
      or 180+ cumulative days and has never acted on eir own behalf to
      cause another person to gain a White Ribbon (including under a
      previous ruleset) CAN act on eir own behalf to cause another
      person to earn a White Ribbon by announcement.
      
      Black (K): An instrument CAN, as part of its effect, cause a
      person to earn a Black Ribbon.
      
      Gray (A): Once per month the Tailor CAN, by announcement, cause a
      specified player to earn a Gray Ribbon. E is ENCOURAGED to do so
      before publishing eir monthly report.
      
      Transparent (T): A person qualifies for a Transparent Ribbon while
      the number of other types of Ribbon that that person qualified for
      within the previous 7 days is at least 5.
      
      When a person earns a White, Black or Gray Ribbon, this Rule
      awards that person a Ribbon of that type.
      
      While a person qualifies for a type of Ribbon:
      
        - If e has not owned that type of Ribbon within the preceding 7
          days, any player CAN, by announcement, award em that type of
          Ribbon.
      
      Qualifying for ribbons is secured. Earning ribbons is secured.

Rule 2480/9 (Power=3.1)
Festivals

      Festivity is a secured singleton switch, whose possible values are
      integers ranging from 0 inclusive to the number of defined types
      of Ribbon exclusive, and defaulting to 0. Festivity is tracked in
      the Tailor's monthly report. In addition, while Festivity is
      non-zero, the Tailor SHALL announce its value each week; a public
      document purporting to be such an announcement is self-ratifying.
      A Festival is ongoing whenever Agora's Festivity is non-zero.
      
      If Agora's Festivity has had the same non-zero value for 14 days
      or more, or if it has a non-zero value and fewer than 5 players
      are Festive, then any player CAN flip it to 0 by announcement.
      
      A Festive person is a person whose Laudability is greater than or
      equal to Agora's Festivity. An N-Festive person is a person who
      would be Festive, were Agora's Festivity N.
      
      For any integer N greater than Agora's Festivity, an N-Festive
      player CAN flip Agora's Festivity to N with 4 support from other
      N-Festive players, unless Agora's Festivity has had a value
      greater than or equal to N in the past 21 days.

Festival Restrictions

      While Agora's Festivity is non-zero, the following apply:
      
      1. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, non-Festive players
         CANNOT support/be a supporter for tabled action intents;
      
      2. Quorum for Agoran Decisions is equal to half the number of
         Festive players, rounded up;
      
      3. Each Festive player has the maximum possible voting strength.
         Each person who is not a Festive player has the minimum
         possible voting strength. Rules to the contrary
         notwithstanding, no modifications to voting strength (other
         than defining the maximum and minimum) are applied by any other
         Rule.
      
      While Agora's Festivity is zero, the paragraphs above have no
      effect and are ignored.

    patent title.
CFJ 1592 (called 01 Dec 2006): A patent title, once borne, is borne
    until explicitly revoked, even if the rule defining the patent title
    is repealed or the patent title was never defined by a rule.
CFJ 1731 (called 23 Aug 2007): It is possible for an entity {a person at
    the time of CFJ 1731} to bear more than one instance of a patent
    title simultaneously.
CFJ 1591 (called 01 Dec 2006): Where a person bears the patent title X,
    and X is not also defined by the rules to have some special meaning,
    it is correct to say that that person "is an X".

Degrees

      Certain patent titles are known as degrees. The degrees are
      
      - Associate of Nomic Art             (A.N.A.)
      - Associate of Nomic                 (A.N.)
      - Juris Doctorate of Nomic           (J.N.)
      - Baccalaureate of Nomic Art         (B.N.A.)
      - Baccalaureate of Nomic             (B.N.)
      - Magisteriate of Nomic Art          (M.N.A.)
      - Magisteriate of Nomic              (M.N.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic Art             (D.N.Art.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic History         (D.N.Hist.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic Law             (D.N.Law.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic Science         (D.N.Sci.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic Philosophy      (D.N.Phil.)
      
      There are four classes of degrees, ranked in ascending order of
      merit: Associate degrees (A.N.A. and A.N.), Baccalaureate degrees
      (J.N through B.N.), Magisteriate degrees (M.N.A and M.N), and
      Doctorate degrees (D.N.Art. through D.N.Phil.).
      
      A specified degree CAN be awarded by any player other than the
      awardee, with 2 Agoran consent. It SHOULD only be awarded for the
      publication of an original thesis of scholarly worth (including
      responses to peer-review), published with explicit intent to
      qualify for a degree. The Herald SHOULD coordinate the peer-review
      process and the awarding of degrees.
      
      Degrees SHOULD be awarded according to the extent to which the
      thesis contributes to Nomic culture or thought: Associate degrees
      for an appreciable contribution, Baccalaureate degrees for a
      substantial contribution, Magisteriate degrees for a remarkable
      contribution, and Doctorate degrees for an exceptional
      contribution. Any degree at the Doctorate level SHOULD take into
      account the awardee's academic history and participation in Agora
      over time.
      
      Theses for Art degrees SHOULD demonstrate substantial creativity
      and need not be in written form. Theses for all other degrees
      SHOULD demonstrate substantial research or analysis. J.N.  and
      D.N.Law are appropriate for high-quality legal analysis, of the
      sort typical to CFJs, but exceeding an ordinary CFJ in depth.  The
      D.N.Hist. degree is appropriate for historical research,
      especially when it presents a narrative that educates Agorans
      about the events of the past. The D.N.Sci. degree is appropriate
      for theses that demonstrate concrete or scientific thinking,
      whereas the D.N.Phil. is appropriate for theses that demonstrate
      abstract or philosophical thinking.

Leaders
   Agora has a good few leaders, most of which are nothing more than
   sinecures. This section isn't all that important.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 103/31 (Power=2)
The Speaker

      The Speaker is an imposed office and the figurehead leader of
      Agora. The player or players who have most recently won the game
      are called Laureled. If at any time the office of Speaker is
      vacant, or when one or more players win Agora, then the Prime
      Minister CAN once appoint a Laureled player to the office of
      Speaker by announcement.
      
      Whenever the Prime Minister CAN appoint a Laureled player to the
      office of Speaker, e SHALL do so in a timely fashion, except that
      the Prime Minister MAY defer appointing a new Speaker while there
      is pending one or more open CFJs that could plausibly determine or
      affect the question of whether a player is Laureled.  If the Prime
      Minister is emself Laureled, eir power to appoint a Speaker
      continues for the entirety of a message in which e resigns as
      Prime Minister, and if e is the only Laureled player, e CAN void
      that power, and thereby discharge the obligation to use it, by
      announcing that e declines to take the office.
      
      If the office of Speaker has been held continuously by the same
      person for the past 90+ days, then any player CAN appoint another
      player to the office with support.

Rule 1727/21 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;
      
      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial Rulesets
      of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets of Nomic
      World and other nomics,
      
      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June 30,
      1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by FIRST SPEAKER
      Michael Norrish, which read, in part,
      
        "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
        precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think we may
        as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules are invited.
        In accordance with the rules, these will be published, numbered
        and distributed by me at my earliest convenience."
      
      And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic,
      known unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was played
      on, until its Players, much later, gave it its OFFICIAL NAME of
      Agora,
      
      And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest, and
      most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the hard work
      and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent advice of
      Agoraphobes,
      
      And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
      founding,
      
      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year.

Rule 2464/8 (Power=1)
Tournaments

      A Tournament is a sub-game of Agora specifically sanctioned to be
      initiated as a tournament by the Rules. Each time that one or more
      winners of a tournament are determined before it concludes, that
      person or those persons win the game. A tournament concludes when
      its regulations state that it concludes. Additionally, if it has
      not previously concluded, a tournament concludes 3 months after
      its initiation.
      
      A Tournament is governed by a set of regulations, created in
      accordance with its parent rule, which have binding control over
      those who freely consent to oversee or participate in the
      tournament and over the tournament itself. When a tournament is
      initiated, its governing regulations are enacted. Once the
      tournament is concluded, these regulations cease to have any
      effect, and CAN be repealed by any player by announcement. A
      Tournament's regulations collectively have Mint Authority.
      
      Unless otherwise specified by the tournament's regulations, the
      gamemaster of a tournament is the person who initiated it.
      
      A tournament's regulations can provide for the enactment,
      amendment, and repeal of regulations for that tournament; if the
      regulations are silent, the gamemaster CAN, with 2 Agoran consent,
      enact, amend, or repeal such regulations. Any regulations so
      enacted are deemed to be regulations of the same tournament.

Free Tournaments

      A player who is not the gamemaster of an existing tournament CAN
      initiate a sanctioned tournament with a specified set of
      regulations with 2 Agoran consent. A tournament created using this
      method is called a Free Tournament.
      
      A free tournament CAN be concluded with no winner without 3
      objections. Tournaments SHOULD only be concluded in this manner if

      Tournament for that year; the Herald CAN also delegate the
      responsibility for creating or running the tournament to another
      player, with that player's consent, by announcement.
      
      The Birthday Tournament's regulations SHOULD be such that all
      persons who choose to participate have a fair chance of winning
      the tournament (according to its regulations), and a winner
      SHOULD be expected within 2-3 weeks following the tournament's
      initiation.
      
      After adequate time for discussion of the Birthday Tournament's
      regulations, the Herald (or delegate) CAN initiate a sanctioned
      tournament, specifying a finalized set of governing regulations,
      without 3 objections. These regulations may thereafter be amended
      only by the Herald or eir designee Without 3 Objections. The
      initiation SHOULD be timed to coincide with Agora's Birthday.

Hats

      Hats are a secured player switch defaulting to "none" with the
      following possible values and associated meanings for the player's
      current focus:
      
        none: no particular focus
      
        armored helm: competing for wins and in sub-games
      
        dunce cap: expressing regret or acknowledging a mistake
      
        floral wreath: resolving conflict
      
        green eyeshade: maintaining accurate records
      
        hard hat: repairing problems in the rules
      
        jaunty beret: exploring creative expression
      
        jester's cap: bringing levity and humor
      
        judicial wig: ruling on CFJs and interpreting the rules
      
        knitted cap: finding loopholes and exploits
      
        plain hat: simplifying the rules
      
        rugged fedora: researching Agoran and Nomic history
      
        sleeping cap: reducing eir participation in Agora
      
        steampunk hat: creating new game mechanics
      
        traditional mortarboard: conducting research and writing theses
      
      A player CAN change eir hat at any time by notifying the
      recordkeepor for eir hat (publicly or privately). The recordkeepor
      for a player's hat is the player emself. Rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, reporting on one's own hat is OPTIONAL.
      
      Hats do not otherwise limit or restrict a player's actions in any
      way, and every player is ENCOURAGED to participate in all aspects
      of the game regardless of eir current hat.

Rule 2683/3 (Power=0.5)
The Boulder

      The Absurdor is a sortitioned office.
      
      The Boulder's Height is a singleton integer switch defaulting to
      0, tracked by the Absurdor.
      
      The Boulder's Slope is a singleton integer switch defaulting to 1,
      tracked by the Absurdor.
      
      Each player CAN, once a week, by announcement, push the boulder.
      When a player pushes the Boulder, its Height is increased by 1.
      At the beginning of each week, if the boulder was pushed in the
      previous week at least as many times as the Boulder's Slope, then
      the Boulder's Slope is increased by 1; otherwise, the Boulder's
      Height is set to 0, and the Boulder's Slope is set to 1. The
      Absurdor SHOULD list the largest Height and Slope of the Boulder
      ever reached in eir report.

CFJ 4095 (called 23 Sep 2024): The Height switch is not associated with

Rule 2695/3 (Power=0.5)
The Veblen

      The Veblen is a unique indestructible fixed asset tracked by the
      Absurdor, with ownership entirely restricted to players and Agora.
      If the Veblen would otherwise be in abeyance, or if it is owned by
      the Lost and Found Department, it is immediately transferred to
      Agora.
      
      The Veblen cost is a secured singleton positive integer switch
      tracked by the Absurdor and with default value one.
      
      A player CAN pay a fee of X spendies, where X is an integer not
      less than the current Veblen cost, to set the Veblen cost to X+1.
      When e does so, if e does not own the Veblen, the Veblen is
      transferred to em.
      
      If the Veblen has not been transferred or devalued within the past
      month, then a player CAN devalue the Veblen by announcement, thus
      setting the Veblen cost to half its current value (rounded up).
      
      The owner of the Veblen SHOULD conspicuously show off eir
      ownership of it from time to time.

Rule 2702/0 (Power=1.0)
Agoran Bingo

      The Collar is an elected office responsible for administering
      Agoran Bingo.
      
      Bingo state is a singleton switch tracked by the Collar with
      possible values paused (default) and unpaused.
      
      If the bingo state is paused, the Collar CAN flip it to unpaused
      by announcement, and e SHOULD do so unless there is reasonable
      uncertainty as to the current bingo state or the validity of a
      claimed bingo, or the Collar is actively drafting, discussing, or
      trying to enact or amend eir administrative regulations. When the
      bingo state is paused, all existing bingo board selections are
      null and void, a player CANNOT select a bingo board, and a player
      CANNOT call bingo.
      
      If the bingo state is unpaused, a player whose bingo board
      contains at least one winning pattern of conditions -- as defined
      in the Collar's regulations -- that are all satisfied CAN call
      bingo by announcement. (For clarity, the states of any conditions
      not in the winning pattern are irrelevant.) Eir announcement:
      
      1) MUST specify the claimed winning pattern and the conditions it
         contains;
      
      2) MUST reveal any information required by the Collar's
         adminstrative regulations for the method e used to select a
         bingo board; and
      
      3) SHOULD include evidence demonstrating that each of the
        conditions in the winning pattern is satisfied, other than any
        conditions where such satisfaction is already clearly obvious.
      
      When a player successfully calls bingo, e wins the game and the
      bingo state is flipped to paused.
      
      If no player has successfully called bingo in the previous 3
      months, the Collar can flip the bingo state to paused without 2
      objections.

Rule 2703/0 (Power=1.0)
Regulating Agoran Bingo

      The Collar SHOULD try to enact and maintain administrative
      regulations defining:
      
      * one or more methods for a player to select a bingo board;
      
      * the conditions that can be included on a player's bingo board;
        and
      
      * one or more winning bingo patterns
      
      The methods for selecting a bingo board SHOULD be such that:
      
      * there is at least one method that permits a player to keep eir
        bingo board secret until e calls bingo;
      
      * a player cannot change eir selection once made; and
      
      * a player cannot choose in advance with certainty the board e
        will end up with
      
      Additionally, for each method of selecting a bingo board, the
      Collar's regulations SHOULD specifiy:
      
      * what information, if any, a player electing that method MUST
        reveal in order to successfully call bingo; and
      
      * what information, if any, the Collar MUST include in eir weekly
        report for each player electing that method
