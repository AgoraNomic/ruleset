CFJ 825 (called 07 Nov 1995): Players must obey the Rules even if no
   Rule says so.
CFJ 1848 (called 21 Dec 2007): The game must operate according to the
   rules that prevail at the time, and not attempt to incorporate any
   retroactive changes made in the future.
CFJ 1709 (called 26 Jul 2007): The rules are binding on all those who
   play the game in the broader sense, regardless of whether they have
   the rule-defined status of "player".
CFJ 1911-1914 (called 18 Mar 2008): Physical realities supersede the
   Rules by default.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1698/6 (Power=4)
Agora Is A Nomic

      Agora is ossified if it is IMPOSSIBLE for any reasonable
      combination of actions by players to cause arbitrary rule changes
      to be made and/or arbitrary proposals to be adopted within a
      four-week period.
      
      If, but for this rule, the net effect of a proposal would cause
      Agora to become ossified, or would cause Agora to cease to exist,
      it cannot take effect, rules to the contrary notwithstanding. If
      any other single change or inseparable group of changes to the
      gamestate would cause Agora to become ossified, or would cause
      Agora to cease to exist, it is cancelled and does not occur, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.

Important Temporary Rules
   This category is a temporary dumping ground for rules that don't
   easily fit in any other category but that hold special relevance
   for the current gamestate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2633/0 (Power=1.0)
Rulebending

      G. CAN, by announcement, make a Rulebender (defined as being an
      active player holding the patent title of Rulebender) into a
      Rulebending Magister, or make any entity cease being a rulebending
      magister.  Changes to an entity's rulebending magister status are
      secured.
      
      A rulebending magister CAN demonstrate a Rulebending Form by
      announcement, specifying a published document as being the form.
      When e does so, the form's power is set to the power of this rule,
      it takes effect as an ephemeral instrument, and then its power is
      set to 0.  However, a rulebending form CANNOT apply any of the
      following changes:
      
      - rule changes;
      - the creation, destruction, or transfer of assets;
      - the flipping of switches;
      - the creation, modification, or termination of any pledge,
        promise, or contract;
      - the changing of an entity's rulebending magister status.
      
      G. CAN cause this rule to repeal itself by announcement.

Players
   This small section provides some rules detailing how joining and
   leaving Agora works. If you're a new player, this is probably the
   most important section to read.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 869/47 (Power=3)
How to Join and Leave Agora

      Any entity that is or ever was an organism generally capable of
      freely originating and communicating independent thoughts and
      ideas is a person. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no other
      entities are persons.
      
      Citizenship is a secured person switch with values Unregistered
      (default) and Registered, tracked by the Registrar. A registered
      person is a Player. To "register" someone is to flip that person's
      Citizenship switch from Unregistered to Registered.
      
      An Unregistered person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or
      prevented by the rules) register by publishing a message that
      indicates reasonably clearly and reasonably unambiguously that e
      intends to become a player at that time. A player, acting as
      emself, CAN deregister (cease being a player) by announcement. If
      e does so, e CANNOT register or be registered for 30 days.
      
      A person, by registering, agrees to abide by the Rules. The Rules
      CANNOT otherwise bind a person to abide by any agreement without
      that person's willful consent.
      
      The Rules CANNOT compel non-players to act without their express
      or reasonably implied consent. The rules CANNOT compel players to
      unduly harass non-players. A non-person CANNOT be a player, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.

Amended(47) by P8485 'Eternal Personhood' (Gaelan, Aris), 10 Aug 2020

Annotations:
CFJ 1275 (called 19 Feb 2001): An entity is a Player if the Rules cannot
   distinguish that entity from a Player.
CFJ 1263 (called 05 Feb 2001): Any message expressing a clear desire or
   intent to register as a Player counts as a request for registration,
   whether or not it is explicitly phrased in the manner stipulated by
   the rules.
CFJ 3558 (called 06 Sep 2017): Registering by publishing that you want
   to be a player is a different mechanism than registering "by
   announcement" and so gets around rules limitations on "registering by
   announcement".
CFJ 3625 (called 12 Feb 2018): The rules don't bind recently
   deregistered players to avoid re-registering, they merely declare
   such attempts ineffective. Also, agreeing to be bound by some of the
   rules doesn't count as agreeing to be bound by all of them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 478/38 (Power=3)
Fora

      Freedom of speech being essential for the healthy functioning of
      any non-Imperial nomic, it is hereby resolved that no Player shall
      be prohibited from participating in the Fora, nor shall any person
      create physical or technological obstacles that unduly favor some
      players' fora access over others.
      
      Publicity is a secured forum switch with values Public,
      Discussion, and Foreign (default), tracked by the Registrar.
      
      The Registrar may change the publicity of a forum without
      objection as long as:
      
      1. e sends eir announcement of intent to that forum; and
      
      2. if the forum is to be made public, the announcement by which
         the Registrar makes that forum public is sent to all existing
         public fora.
      
      Each player should ensure e can receive messages via each public
      forum.
      
      A public message is a message sent via a public forum, or sent to
      all players and containing a clear designation of intent to be
      public. A rule can also designate that a part of one public
      message is considered a public message in its own right. To
      "publish" or "announce" something is to send a public message
      whose body contains that thing. To do something "publicly" is
      to do that thing within a public message.
      
      Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
      announcement", that person performs that action by unambiguously
      and clearly specifying the action and announcing that e performs
      it. Any action performed by sending a message is performed at the
      time date-stamped on that message. Actions in messages (including
      sub-messages) are performed in the order they appear in the
      message, unless otherwise specified.

Annotations:
CFJ 1451-1452 (called 06 Mar 2003): A message that is split into
   multiple email messages can qualify as a single message for game
   purposes, if it is obvious how to combine the parts to reconstruct
   the single message.
CFJ 752 (called 13 Mar 1995): Something sent to a Player who is
   obligated to send it to all Players is sufficient for sending
   something to the PF.
CFJ 813 (called 22 Oct 1995): A Player need not prove that e can receive
   the PF.
CFJ 831 (called 10 Nov 1995): 'The Date: header of a message is not
   necessarily the time at which the message takes effect.'
CFJ 2205 (called 02 Oct 2008): A message takes effect at exactly one of
   the times date-stamped on it; selecting which one is a matter of game
   custom.
CFJ 2212 (called 07 Oct 2008): An IRC channel is a forum.
CFJ 2211 (called 07 Oct 2008): It is generally possible for an IRC
   channel to be a public forum.
CFJ 2214 (called 07 Oct 2008): Some IRC messages, such as NICK, are sent
   to all members of an IRC channel but are not sent via that channel.
CFJ 866 (called 08 Apr 1996): A message is "received" when the message
   enters the recipient's normal technical domain of control, whether
   this be eir private machine or eir private account on a shared
   machine (but not the shared machine itself, if the recipient does not
   control it).
CFJ 1112: In order to submit a Proposal, in the sense of R1865 and
   elsewhere, it is not sufficient that a collection of text 'with the
   clear indication that that text is intended to become a Proposal'
   (R1483) merely be sent to the Public Forum by a Proposing Entity; the
   collection of text must also be received in the Public Forum.
CFJ 1214-1215 (called 14 May 2000): Conditional actions (of the form "If
   X, I do Y") are effective only where the relevant agents (such as
   recordkeepors) are able to conclusively determine the value of the
   conditional from publicly-available information.
CFJ 1314 (called 15 Aug 2001): If a message sent to a public forum is
   rejected by the list moderator, it still qualifies as having been
   sent via a public forum.
CFJ 1905 (called 07 Feb 2008): Regardless of CFJ 1314, a message has not
   been sent via a forum until most persons who have arranged to receive
   messages via the forum receive it.
CFJ 1888 (called 31 Jan 2008): Sending a message to a Discussion Forum,
   or other mailing list except for a Public Forum, does not qualify as
   sending it to all players.
CFJ 1631 (called 29 Apr 2007): Public announcements must be made in the
   message body; the subject line is insignificant.
CFJ 1784 (called 05 Nov 2007): An undescriptive or misleading subject
   line does not deprive the message body of effect.
CFJ 1880 (called 22 Jan 2008): A phrase that would, in the message body,
   cancel the effect of the rest of the message, does not have such an
   effect if it appears in the subject line.
CFJ 1761 (called 30 Sep 2007): Publishing part of a message is a
   different action from publishing the whole message.
CFJ 1646 (called 30 Apr 2007): The act of "publishing" or "announcing"
   is accomplished when the message has left the sender's technical
   domain of control, indicated by one of the "Received:" headers0.
CFJ 1695 (called 23 Jun 2007): A partnership, which by its nature can't
   directly send email, can participate in the fora by means of its
   members sending messages on its behalf, if its governing agreement
   says so.
CFJ 1768 (called 22 Oct 2007): The right of participation in the fora is
   the right to participate in them for their intended purposes, and is
   not necessarily infringed by regulations regarding the manner and
   type of participation.
CFJ 1738 (called 29 Aug 2007): An obligation on a player to not publish
   statements that e believes are true would conflict with the right of
   participation in the fora.
CFJ 1719 (called 12 Aug 2007): A player can, if e intends, have public
   messages sent on eir behalf, including via a web form that allows
   all-comers to send messages on eir behalf without specific approval.
CFJ 1833-1834 (called 18 Dec 2007): A player can, by contractual
   arrangement, grant another player the capacity to act by announcement
   on eir behalf.
CFJ 1893 (called 03 Feb 2008): A non-consensual non-contractual
   arrangement cannot grant a player the capacity to act by announcement
   on behalf of another.
CFJ 2397 (called 03 Mar 2009): A player can grant or revoke permission
   at will for another player to act by announcement on eir behalf.
CFJ 2322 (called 24 Dec 2008): The ability to act on behalf can be
   created by any willful agreement.
CFJ 1336 (called 13 Dec 2001): A public statement that one wishes to
   perform an action that one can perform by announcement can constitute
   an announcement that performs that action.
CFJ 1621 (called 08 Feb 2007): Where an action can be performed by
   announcement, announcing that one deems something to be the case that
   would result from that action does not constitute performing the
   action.
CFJ 1584 (called 24 Feb 2006): CFJ 1584 (called 24 Feb 2006), CFJ 1728
   (called 20 Aug 2007): ' Saying "I do X 1000 times", where X is
   something that can be done by announcement, is an acceptable
   shorthand for 1000 instances of "I do X", but this shorthand cannot
   be used with an infinite repeat count, because it is impossible to
   write out an infinite number of instances of "I do X".'
CFJ 1774 (called 01 Nov 2007): Saying "I do X 10000 times", where X is
   something that can be done by announcement, does not necessarily
   achieve 10000 instances of X, if writing out 10000 instances of "I do
   X" would be a substantial effort such that using the shorthand is
   abusive. The presumption is in favour of the shorthand being
   successful.
CFJ 1775 (called 01 Nov 2007): If an announcement of the form "I do X N
   times" is not be acceptable shorthand for N instances of "I do X",
   then the announcement is completely nullified, and does not have the
   effect of M instances of "I do X" for any non-zero repeat count M.
CFJ 1730 (called 22 Aug 2007): An appropriate announcement will
   accomplish an action even if its author believed the action was
   impossible.
CFJ 1841 (called 20 Dec 2007): A message-based action cannot be
   retroactive.
CFJ 1971 (called 22 May 2008): An announcement with a general disclaimer
   as to its contents cannot fulfill a requirement to report
   information, but it may successfully cause game actions to be taken
   if the actions do not depend on the truth value of the disclaimed
   contents.
CFJ 2133 (called 09 Aug 2008): A disclaimed statement cannot cause an
   action to be taken by announcement.
CFJ 2112 (called 23 Jul 2008): An action is only taken by announcement
   if the Rules define it as such; e.g., posting an objection to a
   dependent action is not an action taken by announcement.
CFJ 2151 (called 05 Sep 2008): Some unregulated actions, such as
   celebrating and revealing things, can be taken by announcement.
CFJ 2086 (called 15 Jul 2008): Message-based actions are always taken in
   some order, never precisely simultaneously, possibly unless otherwise
   stated.
CFJ 2179 (called 23 Sep 2008): An message-based action can be taken even
   if its sender cannot be identified.
CFJ 2221 (called 13 Oct 2008): When an action is specified as "can do X
   in order to do Y", and a player does X without specifying intent to
   do Y, e does not do Y.
CFJ 2238 (called 22 Oct 2008): The requirement of unambiguous
   specification applies to the parameters of an action.
CFJ 2363 (called 01 Feb 2009): "X can do Y by doing Z" does not imply
   that X can do Z.
CFJ 2441 (called 06 Apr 2009): Due to a limitation of the mailing list
   archives, attaching a message with a particular text does not count
   as publishing that text.
CFJ 3025 (called 15 May 2011): If it is clear what he did, then it must
   be clear what he did; if it is not clear what he did, then it is not
   clear what he did.
CFJ 3106 (called 19 Oct 2011): When a person announces that "e performs"
   an action, the referent of "e" (i.e. eir identity) must be clear.
CFJ 3002 (called 19 Apr 2011): A message of the form "This statement
   causes {action}" is ineffective as a way to perform {action}, and may
   be an attempt to act on behalf of the statement.
CFJ 2899 (called 12 Nov 2010): A player's real name does not necessary
   identify em.
CFJ 3409 (called 09 Apr 2014): An action can be performed in the subject
   line of a message, if it sufficiently clear (as outlined in the
   judgment).
CFJ 3603-3604 (called 16 Nov 2017): ASCII art of text can be clear
   enough to suffice for communications, and in particular for taking
   actions by announcement.
CFJ 3630 (called 02 Mar 2018): An action referencing outside content
   requires that the attempt to act is clear, the nature of the
   attempted action is clear, and the outside context cannot be altered
   by em and will remain available long enough for others to interpret
   it.
CFJ 3642 (called 15 Jun 2018): Regardless of CFJ 1314, a message has not
   been sent via a public forum if its non-reception by some persons who
   arranged to receive it has affected which game actions they chose to
   take or not to take.
CFJ 3790 (called 01 Jan 2020): The sender of a message is the last
   exerciser of free will that exercised free will on its path.

Rule 1789/11 (Power=3)
Cantus Cygneus

      Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously by
      the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part of
      it, e may submit a document to the Registrar, clearly labeled a
      Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and expressing eir
      reproach for those who e feels have treated em so badly.
      
      In a timely fashion after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the
      Registrar shall publish this document along with a Writ of
      Fugiendae Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione, commanding the Player
      to be deregistered. The Registrar shall note the method of
      deregistration for that Player in subsequent Registrar montly
      Reports.
      
      The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and the
      notation in the Registrar's monthly report will ensure that,
      henceforth, all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of
      FAGE.

General Definitions
   This section describes the terminology used by all the other rules.
   If, when reading a rule, you don't understand what a word means,
   chances are that the Agoran definition of that word is described in
   one of these rules.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2152/8 (Power=3)
Mother, May I?

      The following terms are defined. These definitions are used when a
      rule includes a term in all caps, and provide guidance in
      determining the ordinary-language meaning of a term when a rule
      includes a term otherwise. Earlier definitions take precedence
      over later ones. If a rule specifies one or more persons in
      connection with a term, then the term applies only to the
      specified person(s).
      
      1. CANNOT, IMPOSSIBLE, INEFFECTIVE, INVALID: Attempts to perform
         the described action are unsuccessful.
      
      2. MUST NOT, MAY NOT, SHALL NOT, ILLEGAL, PROHIBITED: Performing
         the described action violates the rule in question.
      
      3. NEED NOT, OPTIONAL: Failing to perform the described action
         does not violate the rules.
      
      4. SHOULD NOT, DISCOURAGED, DEPRECATED: Before performing the
         described action, the full implications of performing it should
         be understood and carefully weighed.
      
      5. CAN, POSSIBLE: Attempts to perform the described action are
         successful.
      
      6. MAY: Performing the described action does not violate the
         rules.
      
      7. MUST, SHALL, REQUIRED, MANDATORY: Failing to perform the
         described action violates the rule in question.
      
      8. SHOULD, ENCOURAGED, RECOMMENDED: Before failing to perform the
         described action, the full implications of failing to perform
         it should (in the ordinary-language sense) be understood and
         carefully weighed.

CFJ 1132: A Player failing to perform a duty required by the Rules
   within a reasonable time may be in violation of the Rules, even if
   the Rules do not provide a time limit for the performance of that

CFJ 1488 (called 11 Feb 2004): Engineering a situation in which other
   players are unable to follow a particular rule is not in itself a
   violation of that rule.
CFJ 2395 (called 01 Mar 2009): Even without this being explicitly
   specified in the rules, it is possible for a non-player to violate a
   rule by missing a deadline.
CFJ 1990 (called 07 Jun 2008): "Allowed" may refer to either possibility
   or permissibility depending on context.
CFJ 2120-2121 (called 04 Aug 2008): A requirement of the form 'within
   <time limit>, a player SHALL <action> by announcement' means that the
   player CAN perform the action, and SHALL do so within the time
   limit.
CFJ 2230 (called 16 Oct 2008): In a statement of the form "an action
   that X may take", 'may' generally means 'might', i.e. CAN.
CFJ 2282 (called 19 Nov 2008): To state that an entity "MUST" have
   certain properties refers to possibility, not legality.
CFJ 2414 (called 14 Mar 2009): A rule of the form "X SHOULD be
   interpreted as Y" does not allow players to bypass the interpretation
   by failing to perform the described action.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2509/2 (Power=2)
Agoran Numbers

      A "number" is considered to refer to a real number, unless
      otherwise explicitly specified.  A "number of (items)", where
      (items) is a set of discrete entities, is considered to refer to a
      non-negative integer, unless otherwise explicitly specified.
      
      If a switch is defined as being associated with a specified set of
      numbers (a numerical switch), then the possible values for that
      switch are the numbers in that set. In particular, a natural or
      integer switch is a switch with possible values the non-negative
      integers or all integers, respectively. If a limit is further
      defined, the possible values are the numbers of the set within the
      specified limits.
      
      If 0 is in the specified values for a numerical switch and no
      default value is otherwise specified, 0 is the default value for
      that switch.
      
      If the rules describe mathematical operations to be used in
      flipping an instance of a numerical switch, the operations are
      interpreted as having common-sense mathematical application to
      determine that instance's resulting value. For example,
      "increasing a switch instance by M" is equivalent to "flipping a
      switch instance from its current value N to the value N+M". If the
      specified mathematical operation would result in a value outside
      that switch's defined set, the flipping CANNOT be performed, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.

Rule 2125/12 (Power=3)
Regulated Actions

      An action is regulated by a body of law if (1) its performance is
      limited, allowed, enabled, or permitted by that body of law; (2)
      that body of law describes the circumstances under which it would
      succeed or fail; or (3) it would, as part of its effect, modify
      information for which some person bound by that body of law is
      required, by that body of law, to be a recordkeepor.
      
      If a body of law regulates an action, then to the extent that
      doing so is within its scope, that body of law prevents the action
      from being performed except as described within it, including by
      limiting the methods to perform that action to those specified
      within it. A body of law does not proscribe any action which it
      does not regulate.

Annotations:
CFJ 3737 (called 15 Jun 2019): Actions that the rules state a player
   SHALL NOT perform are considered to be regulated actions.
CFJ 3793 (called 16 Jan 2020): Rule 2125 is an interpretive principle
   applied to the rules as a whole and not to any individual rule. For a
   method to be explicitly specified, it must actually specify a way
   that the action can be realized; it is not enough that a rule claims
   there is a method. Circular reasoning cannot be used to permit an
   action or to provide a method.

Rule 1023/40 (Power=2)
Agoran Time

      The following terms are defined:
      
      1. The phrase "in a timely fashion" means "within 7 days". This
         time period is set when the requirement is created (i.e. X days
         before the limit ends). A requirement to perform an action at
         an exact instant (e.g. "when X, Y SHALL Z"), but not "in the
         same message", is instead interpreted as a requirement to
         perform that action in a timely fashion after that instant.
      
      2. The phrase "in an officially timely fashion" means "before the
         end of the next Agoran week". This time period is set when the
         requirement is created (i.e. between 7 and 14 days before the
         period ends).
      
      3. Agoran epochs:
      
           1. Agoran days begin at midnight UTC.
      
           2. Agoran weeks begin at midnight UTC on Monday. Eastman
              weeks begin at midnight UTC on the 1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd,
              and 29th of each Gregorian month; the fifth one of the
              month (if any) lasts till the end of the month.
      
           3. Agoran months begin at midnight UTC on the first day of
              each Gregorian month.
      
           4. Agoran quarters begin when the Agoran months of January,
              April, July, and October begin.
      
           5. Agoran years begin when the Agoran month of January
              begins.
      
           6. A pivot is either the instant at which Agora Nomic began
              (June 30, 1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200) or an instant at which
              at least one person won the game. When used as a period of
              time, a "Round" (historical syn: "game") is the period of
              time between a pivot and the next pivot.
      
         The "Agoran" qualifier is assumed unless a different definition
         is indicated (e.g. Eastman weeks). These definitions do not
         apply to relative durations (e.g. "within <number> days after
         <event>").
      
      4. Two points in time are within a month of each other if:
      
          1. they occur in the same Agoran month;
      
          2. they occur in two consecutive Agoran months, and the later
             of the two occurs in an earlier day in the month than the
             earlier one;
      
          3. they occur in two consecutive Agoran months on the same day
             of the month, and the later of the two occurs at the same
             or earlier time of day.

Rule 1728/42 (Power=3)
Dependent Action Methods

      The following methods of taking actions are known as "dependent
      actions":
      
      1. without N objections, where N is a positive integer no greater
      than 8 ("without objection" is shorthand for this method with
      N = 1);
      
      2. with N support, where N is a positive integer ("with support"
      is shorthand for this method with N = 1);
      
      3. with N Agoran consent, where N is an integer multiple of 0.1
      with a minimum of 1 ("With Agoran consent" is shorthand for this
      method with N = 1);
      
      4. with notice; or
      
      5. with T notice, where T is a time period.
      
      N is 1 unless otherwise specified.

Annotations:
CFJ 1722 (called 15 Aug 2007): The method of dependent action need not

   suffices, as does the rule-defined term.
CFJ 1802 (called 19 Nov 2007): The phrase "by Agoran Support" is not an
   unambiguous description of a method of dependent action.
CFJ 3567 (called 27 Sep 2017): Dependent action intents aren't "by
   announcement" actions, so a message saying it a lot of times can be
   read "naturally" as counting as a single intent.

Rule 2595/2 (Power=3)
Performing a Dependent Action

      A rule that purports to allow a person (the performer) to perform
      an action by a set of one or more dependent actions thereby allows
      em to perform the action by announcement if all of the following
      are true:
      
      1. A person (the initiator) published an announcement of intent
         that unambiguously, clearly, conspicuously, and without
         obfuscation specified the action intended to be taken and the
         method(s) to be used;
      
      2. The announcement referenced in paragraph (1) of this Rule
         unambiguously, clearly, conspicuously, and without obfuscation
         states:
      
         * the value of T, if the action is to be taken with T notice;
           and
      
         * the value of N, if N is not equal to 1 and the action is to
           be taken without N objections, with N support, or with N
           Agoran Consent;
      
      3. The announcement referenced in paragraph (1) of this Rule was
         published:
      
         * within the 14 days preceding the action, if the action is to
           be performed with N support;
      
         * between 4 and 14 days preceding the action, if the action is
           to be performed without N objections, with N Agoran consent,
           or with notice; or
      
         * between T and 14 days preceding the action, if the action is
           to be performed with T notice;
      
      4. At least one of the following is true:
      
           * the performer is the initiator;
      
           * the initiator was authorized to perform the action due to
             holding a rule-defined position now held by the performer;
             or
      
           * the initiator is authorized to perform the action, the
             action depends on support, the performer has supported the
             intent, and the rule authorizing the performance does not
             explicitly prohibit supporters from performing it;
      
      5. Agora is Satisfied with the announced intent, as defined by
         other Rules; and
      
      6. The conditions are all met, if any conditions were stated in
         the announcement of intent referenced in paragraph (1) of this
         Rule.
      
      The performer SHOULD publish a list of supporters and objectors if
      the action is to be taken with N Agoran consent.

Rule 2124/27 (Power=2)
Agoran Satisfaction

      A Supporter of an intent to perform an action is an eligible
      entity who has publicly posted (and not withdrawn) support for an
      announcement of that intent. An Objector to an intent to perform
      an action is an eligible entity who has publicly posted (and not
      withdrawn) an objection to the announcement of that intent.
      
      The entities eligible to support or object to an intent to perform
      an action are, by default, all players, subject to modification by
      the document authorizing the dependent action. However, the
      previous sentence notwithstanding, the initiator of the intent is
      not eligible to support it.
      
      Agora is Satisfied with an intent to perform a specific action
      unless at least one of the following is true:
      
      1. The action is to be performed Without N objections, and there
         are at least N Objectors to that intent.
      
      2. The action is to be performed With N support, and there are
         fewer than than N Supporters of that intent.
      
      3. The action is to be performed with N Agoran consent, and the
         number of Supporters of the intent is less than or equal to N
         times the number of Objectors to the intent.
      
      The above notwithstanding, if an action is to be performed without
      N objections or with N Agoran consent, and an objection to an
      intent to perform it has been withdrawn within the past 24 hours,
      then Agora is not Satisfied with that intent.
      
      The above notwithstanding, Agora is not satisfied with an intent
      if the Speaker has objected to it in the last 48 hours.
      
      A person CANNOT support or object to an announcement of intent
      before the intent is announced, or after e has withdrawn the same
      type of response.

Entities
   "Entity" is a confusing word to new players. This section describes
   what an entity is.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1586/9 (Power=2)
Definition and Continuity of Entities

      If multiple rules attempt to define an entity with the same name,
      then they refer to the same entity. A rule-defined entity's name
      CANNOT be changed to be the same as another rule-defined entity's
      name.
      
      A rule, contract, or regulation that refers to an entity by name
      refers to the entity that had that name when the rule first came
      to include that reference, even if the entity's name has since
      changed.
      
      If the entity that defines another entity is amended such that it
      no longer defines the second entity, then the second entity and
      its attributes cease to exist.
      
      If the entity that defines another entity is amended such that it
      defines the second entity both before and after the amendment, but
      with different attributes, then the second entity and its
      attributes continue to exist to whatever extent is possible under
      the new definitions.

Rule 2162/13 (Power=3)
Switches

      A type of switch is a property that the rules define as a switch,
      and specify the following:
      
      1. The type(s) of entity possessing an instance of that switch. No
         other entity possesses an instance of that switch.
      
      2. One or more possible values for instances of that switch,
         exactly one of which should be designated as the default. No
         values other than those listed are possible for instances of
         that switch, except that, if no default is specified, then
         rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the "null" value is a
         possible value for that switch, and is the default.
      
      3. Optionally, exactly one office whose holder tracks instances of
         that switch. That officer's (weekly, if not specified
         otherwise) report includes the value of each instance of that
         switch whose value is not its default value; a public document
         purporting to be this portion of that officer's report is
         self-ratifying, and implies that other instances are at their
         default value.
      
      At any given time, each instance of a switch has exactly one
      possible value for that type of switch. If an instance of a switch
      comes to have a value, it ceases to have any other value. If an
      instance of a switch would otherwise fail to have a possible
      value, it comes to have its default value. A Rule that designates
      a switch as "secured" (at a given power level) designates changes
      to the properties of that type of switch as secured (at that power
      level) and designates changes to the value of each instance of the
      switch as secured (at that power level).
      
      "To flip an instance of a switch" is to make it come to have a
      given value. "To become X" (where X is a possible value of
      exactly one of the subject's switches) is to flip that switch to
      X.
      
      If a type of switch is not explicitly designated as
      possibly-indeterminate by the rule that defines it, and if an
      action or set of actions would cause the value of an instance of
      that type of switch to become indeterminate, that instance instead
      takes on its last determinate and possible value, if any,
      otherwise it takes on its default value.
      
      A singleton switch is a switch for which Agora Nomic is the only
      entity possessing an instance of that switch.
      
      A boolean switch is a switch with values True and False. A
      positive boolean switch has a default of True; a negative boolean
      switch has a default of False.
      
      Attempting to flip an instance of a switch to a value it already
      has does not flip the switch. However, if a person is REQUIRED to
      flip a switch instance to a value it already has, then either
      attempting to do so using the required mechanism, or announcing
      that the switch already has the required value, fulfills the
      requirement without flipping the switch.

Rule 1688/10 (Power=3)
Power

      The Power of an entity is a non-negative rational number. A
      statute is a document with positive Power.
      
      The Power of an entity cannot be set or modified except as
      stipulated by the Rules. All entities have Power zero except where
      specifically allowed by the rules.
      
      A Rule that makes a change, action, or value secured (hereafter
      the securing Rule) thereby makes it IMPOSSIBLE to perform that
      change or action, or to set or modify that value, except as
      allowed by a Statute with Power greater than or equal to the
      change's Power Threshold.  This Threshold defaults to the securing
      Rule's Power, but CAN be lowered as allowed by that Rule
      (including by the Rule itself).

Rule 2612/0 (Power=3.0)
Bodies of Law

      A body of law is a collection of related instruments and bodies of
      law whose effects are collective and possibly interdependent, and
      which is defined as such by a body of law. The statutes of Agora
      form a body of law with unlimited scope. All other bodies of law
      are defined by a different body of law, in such a way as to be
      able to trace their origins back to the statutes of Agora. Two or
      more bodies of law may jointly define another body of law, but
      only each of them clearly expresses the intent to participate in a
      joint definition with each of the others. Otherwise, the
      definitions are separate, distinct, and unrelated.
      
      A body of law is governed by all bodies of law which, directly or
      indirectly, participate in its definition, as well as any body of
      law specified as governing it by any of its governing law. A body
      of law is subordinate to the law that governs it, other than
      itself, and a body of law is superior to the law that it governs,
      other than itself. For greater certainty, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the statutes of Agora govern all law and are
      governed by no law except themselves, and no body of law can be
      both subordinate to and superior to another.
      
      With respect to interactions between separate bodies of law, a
      body of law is generally to be interpreted as acting harmoniously
      as a single whole. The precedence between, and organization of,
      instruments in a body of law are internal matters to that body of
      law and generally do not affect the effect of other bodies of
      law, except to the extent that they affect the body's operation
      as a whole.
      
      The definition of a body of law includes the definition if its
      scope, being the areas of the game that it governs. By
      definition, the scope of a body of law is no greater than the
      union of the scopes of the bodies of law that define it, nor does
      it include anything which would bring it into direct conflict
      with superior law. To the extent that a body of law's scope is
      not explicitly defined by superior law, it is as broad as
      possible while excluding any effect on any substantive aspect of
      any body of law, besides itself, that it does not govern.
      
      Every instrument is a direct member of exactly one body of law; if
      not specified in its definition, it is a body of law in itself. A
      given fixation of text may, however, be the text of multiple
      instruments, each in different bodies of law. The scope of an
      instrument is the scope of the body of law it forms a part of. To
      the extent that the provisions of an instrument are outside its
      scope, they are void and without effect.

Rule 2611/0 (Power=3.0)
Instruments

      An instrument is a type of document, either ephemeral or enduring,
      that is defined as such by a body of law. An instrument's text,
      where otherwise permitted, can be amended from time to time.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, an instrument other than a
      statute CANNOT become binding on a person without eir willful
      consent, however, consent can be given by implication. In
      particular, consenting to be bound to an instrument can imply
      consent to be bound by amendments to it and consent to be bound by
      other instruments.

Rule 2613/0 (Power=3.0)
Effects of Instruments

      An instrument's effect is defined by its text, as amended from
      time to time in accordance with the law governing its operation. A
      "substantive" aspect of an instrument is any aspect that affects
      the instrument's operation. If an instrument's text contains
      clearly marked comments then, they have no effect on its
      interpretation or operation except as that instrument itself
      specifies, although they remain part of its text. For the purposes
      of rules concerning the methods by which actions are performed, an
      instrument taking effect is such a method.
      
      An enduring instrument is one that it is always taking effect, to
      the extent it is permitted to so by the Rules and any other
      applicable instruments. An enduring instrument is always speaking;
      uses of the present tense in an enduring instrument are
      interpreted contextually according to the applicable rules of
      interpretation.
      
      An ephemeral instrument is one that takes effect only briefly, to
      effect a number of changes on the game. When it takes effect, the
      changes specified in its text are applied, provided that the
      instrument is not prohibited from doing so. Unless otherwise
      specified by the instrument or by its governing law, the
      provisions of an instrument are applied sequentially and
      independently, in the sense that the success or failure of each
      provision does not depend directly on the success or failure of
      any other provision.
      
      An ephemeral instrument has no ongoing effect, except to the
      extent that the changes it makes have ongoing consequences. It
      cannot, except by way of an enduring instrument, extend or delay
      its own effect. An ephemeral instrument CAN, where explicitly
      permitted to do so by the law governing it, override the effect of
      an enduring instrument within its scope by modifying, suppressing,
      or postponing it. Such an override is INEFFECTIVE unless the
      nature and scope of the override are clearly specified either in
      the governing law or, where so authorized by the governing law, in
      the instrument itself.
      
      An instrument or body of law is not, except where it specifies
      otherwise, bound by or restricted in any way by any subordinate
      law and implicitly overrides and takes precedence over all
      provisions, including outright prohibitions or definitions, of all
      subordinate law.

Rule 2350/15 (Power=3)
Proposals

      A proposal is a type of entity consisting of a body of text and
      other attributes. A player CAN create a proposal by announcement,
      specifying its text and optionally specifying any of the following
      attributes:
      
      * An associated title.
      
      * A list of coauthors (which must be persons other than the
        author).
      
      * An adoption index.
      
      * A chamber to which the proposal shall be assigned upon its
        creation.
      
      Creating a proposal adds it to the Proposal Pool. Once a proposal
      is created, its text, author, and AI cannot be changed. The author
      (syn. proposer) of a proposal is the person who submitted it.
      
      The author of a proposal in the Proposal Pool CAN remove (syn.
      retract, withdraw) it from the Pool by announcement.

      proposal and is not listed in the list of co-authors of the
      proposal, e is added to the list of co-authors. When e does so,
      the proposal becomes sponsored.
      
      The Promotor CAN, with 2+X support, flip the Pended switch of a
      proposal in the Proposal Pool to true. For this, X is equal to the

      as follows:
      
       A. Ministry of Justice: serve justice to rulebreakers
       B. Ministry of Efficiency: see official duties performed swiftly
       C. Ministry of Legislation: see votes cast on proposals
       D. Ministry of Participation: reward players for achievements
       E. Ministry of Economy: encourage economic activity and contracts
      
      Interest is secured office switch, tracked by the ADoP, whose
      possible values are lists of ministries, defaulting to the empty
      list. The ADoP CAN flip an office's interest without objection.
      
      For each item of each office's interest, that office's holder's
      voting strength is increased by 2 on proposals whose chamber is
      set to that ministry.

Rule 2606/3 (Power=2.0)
Proposal Classes

      Proposals created since the enactment of this rule have a secured
      untracked Class switch with possible values ordinary (the default)
      and democratic.
      
      When a proposal with an adoption index greater than or equal to
      3.0 is created, its class becomes democratic.
      
      Any player CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, flip an ordinary proposal's
      class to democratic, provided that it is in the Proposal Pool or
      that there is an referendum on it whose voting period has not yet
      ended.

Proposal Chambers

      Chamber is a a secured untracked ordinary proposal switch whose
      possible values include unset (the default) and each of the
      ministries of Agora.
      
      A proposal's chamber SHOULD only be decided by which ministry's
      goals it effects to the greatest degree.
      
      If the chamber of an ordinary proposal in the Proposal Pool is
      unset, the Promotor CAN set the chamber to a specified ministry
      by announcement. Any player CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, flip
      the chamber of an ordinary proposal to any ministry, provided
      that it is in the Proposal Pool or that there is an referendum on
      it whose voting period has not yet ended.
      
      To refer a proposal to a ministry is to set the chamber of that
      proposal to the specified ministry.

Rule 1607/50 (Power=3)
Distribution

      The Promotor is an office; its holder is responsible for receiving
      and distributing proposals.
      
      A referendum is the Agoran decision to determine whether to adopt
      a proposal.  For this decision, the vote collector is the
      Assessor, the adoption index is initially the adoption index of
      the proposal, or 1.0 if the proposal does not have one, and the
      text, author, coauthors, class and (if applicable) chamber of the
      proposal are essential parameters. Initiating a referendum is
      known as distribution, and removes the proposal from the Proposal
      Pool.
      
      The Promotor CAN distribute a proposal which is in the Proposal
      Pool at any time, but SHALL NOT do so unless it is pending.
      
      In a given Agoran week, the Promotor SHALL distribute each
      proposal that was in the Proposal Pool and pending at the
      beginning of that week, except for those excepted from automatic
      distribution by other rules, or those that are otherwise removed
      from the Pool.
      
      If a proposal has been in the proposal pool for more than 7 days
      and is not pending, the Promotor CAN and SHOULD remove it from the
      Pool by announcement.
      
      Distributed proposals have ID numbers, to be assigned by the
      Promotor.
      
      If there is a Proposal in the Pool that it would otherwise be
      IMPOSSIBLE for any player to distribute, then any player CAN
      distribute that Proposal without 3 objections.
      
      The Promotor's report includes a list of all proposals in the
      Proposal Pool, along with their text and attributes. This portion
      of a public document purporting to be a Promotor's report is
      self-ratifying.

CFJ 1546 (called 14 Apr 2005): CFJ 1546 (called 14 Apr 2005), CFJ 1669
   (called 16 May 2007): If a proposal is purportedly distributed with a
   text that differs from the submitted text, this constitutes a legal
   distribution of the submitted proposal if and only if the difference
   does not affect the meaning of the proposal.
CFJ 1655 (called 09 May 2007): Distributing a purported proposal whose
   text consists of the texts of two submitted proposals and separating
   matter from the message that submitted them both, if both submitted
   proposals have non-null effects, does not constitute a legal
   distribution of either of the submitted proposals.
CFJ 1656 (called 09 May 2007): If the Promotor purports to distribute a
   proposal, but the distributed text does not match any proposal in the
   proposal pool, this constitutes the effective (albeit prohibited)
   distribution of a new proposal.
CFJ 1780 (called 04 Nov 2007): If the Promotor creates a new proposal by
   distribution, by accidentally mangling the text of a proposal in the
   pool, and the new proposal is very similar in meaning to the one on
   which it is based (with only inconsequential differences), then the
   author of the new proposal is the author of the proposal on which it
   is based.
CFJ 1780 (called 04 Nov 2007): If the Promotor accidentally creates a
   new proposal by distribution, and the new proposal is seriously
   different from any proposal in the pool, then the new proposal has no
   author.
CFJ 2733 (called 14 Nov 2009): This rule defines a separate method of
   distribution from the one defined in Rule 107.

Rule 106/43 (Power=3)
Adopting Proposals

      When a referendum on a proposal is resolved, if the outcome is
      ADOPTED, then the proposal in question is adopted, its power is
      set to the minimum of four and its adoption index, it takes effect
      as an ephemeral instrument, and then its power is set to 0. This
      rule defers to rules that would prevent a proposal from taking
      effect.
      
      A proposal CAN override the effect of any rule which it is capable
      of amending by specifying that it does so.

Rule 2623/3 (Power=1.0)
Popular Proposal Proposer Privilege

      For a referendum, let F be the total number of valid ballots

      number of valid ballots.  The referendum's popularity is equal to
      (F - A)/T. The Assessor SHOULD publish the popularity of each
      referendum when resolving it.
      
      The author of the most popular sponsored proposal adopted in the
      last 7 days CAN once earn one Legislative Card by announcement,
      provided that no referenda initiated in the same message as it
      remain unresolved. If there is a tie, all authors of the tied
      proposals can do so once each.

Rules & Regulations
   Ah, yes. What would any game be without rules? And these rules
   describe how rules work. This section also describes the governance
   of the Rulekeepor.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2141/14 (Power=3.1)
Role and Attributes of Rules

      A rule is an enduring statute. Every rule has a power between 0.1
      and 4.0, inclusive. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, it is
      IMPOSSIBLE to enact a rule with power outside this range, or to
      change the power of an existing rule to a nonzero value outside
      this range. The set of all currently-existing rules is called the
      ruleset.
      
      Every rule shall have an ID number, distinct among current and
      former rules, to be assigned once by the Rulekeepor.
      
      Every rule shall have a title to aid in identification. If a rule
      ever does not have a title, then the Rulekeepor CAN and SHALL
      assign a title to it by announcement in a timely fashion.
      
      For the purposes of rules governing modification of instruments,
      the text, power, ID number, and title of a rule are all
      substantive aspects of the rule. However, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the Rulekeepor CAN set rule aspects as described
      elsewhere in this rule.

Annotations:
CFJ 1498 (called 12 Apr 2004): A rule's title is not strictly a name for
   the rule, and so rule titles are not subject to the uniqueness
   requirement on names of rule-defined entities.
CFJ 2013 (called 17 Jun 2009): Rule 2141 does not imply that the power
   of rules is physically unlimited: they can only affect the world
   outside the game by prescribing or proscribing player behavior.
CFJ 2213 (called 07 Oct 2008): The powers granted to rules by the first
   paragraph of Rule 2141 are general, and only apply as otherwise
   stated by the Rules.

Rule 217/12 (Power=3)
Interpreting the Rules

      When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
      takes precedence. Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
      unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense, past
      judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the game.
      
      Definitions and prescriptions in the rules are only to be applied
      using direct, forward reasoning; in particular, an absurdity that
      can be concluded from the assumption that a statement about
      rule-defined concepts is false does not constitute proof that it
      is true. Definitions in lower-powered Rules do not overrule
      common-sense interpretations or common definitions of terms in
      higher-powered rules, but may constructively make reasonable
      clarifications to those definitions. For this purpose, a
      clarification is reasonable if and only if it adds detail without
      changing the underlying general meaning of the term and without
      causing the higher powered rule to be read in a way inconsistent
      with its text.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any rule change that would
      (1) prevent a person from initiating a formal process to resolve
      matters of controversy, in the reasonable expectation that the
      controversy will thereby be resolved; or (2) prevent a person from
      causing formal reconsideration of any judicial determination that
      e should be punished, is wholly void and without effect.

Annotations:
CFJ 1439 (called 20 Feb 2003): A difference in language qualifies as a
   difference in dialect; it is possible to take game actions by
   messages in languages other than English.
CFJ 1460 (called 04 Apr 2003): If a message is in a language other than
   English, and its intended audience does not understand the language,
   this constitutes gross unclarity that makes the message ineffective.
CFJ 712: Referring to a Player by a method other than eir name or
   nickname is acceptable, as long as it is unambiguous.
CFJ 1861 (called 08 Jan 2008): A player's legal name (legal in eir
   country of residence) is not necessarily an acceptable way to refer
   to em.
CFJ 1782 (called 04 Nov 2007): Referring to a player by the name of an
   office that e holds suffices to identify em uniquely as a person, if
   there is no doubt regarding who holds that office.
CFJ 1460 (called 04 Apr 2003): Extremely complex synonyms, requiring
   extensive effort to interpret correctly, can constitute a sufficient
   degree of unclarity as to render the message ineffective.
CFJ 1840 (called 20 Dec 2007): A proper noun that has not been
   explicitly defined does not adequately refer to any entity, and is
   not implicitly defined by the context in which it is used.
CFJ 1580 (called 12 Jan 2006): Base64 encoding of (part of) a message,
   other than in the context of MIME with appropriate headers, can
   render a message ineffective for unclarity, because the decoding step
   requires unreasonable effort within the meaning of CFJ 1460.
CFJ 1741 (called 11 Sep 2007): HTML encoding (including numerical
   character entity encoding) does not render a message ineffective for
   unclarity if a suitable MIME type is indicated by a header.
CFJ 1741 (called 11 Sep 2007): An email message does not need the
   RFC-required "MIME-Version:" header in order for it to be interpreted
   in the MIME way.
CFJ 1536 (called 13 Mar 2005): The phrase "AOL!" is not a sufficiently
   clear synonym for "Me too!".
CFJ 1770 (called 23 Oct 2007): A contract can redefine a rule-defined
   term in its own way, and the contract's definition will then apply in
   situations governed by the contract.
CFJ 1885 (called 26 Jan 2008): A word or phrase can acquire a meaning by
   custom, provided that it is a reasonable meaning and does not
   unreasonably change the meaning of phrases that already have a
   meaning.
CFJ 1831 (called 10 Dec 2007): Mentioning a URI, without surrounding
   text stating its significance, does not incorporate anything
   identified by that URI into the message that mentions the URI.
CFJ 1831 (called 10 Dec 2007): Character sequences within a URI by
   default have no significance other than their functional role as part
   of the URI.
CFJ 2258 (called 06 Nov 2008): Changes in whitespace are also
   inconsequential.
CFJ 1139: Interpretations {judgements at the time of CFJ 1139} need not
   necessarily accord with the reasoning and arguments of Judges or
   Justices given in past CFJs.
CFJ 3793 (called 16 Jan 2020): The "text of the rules", for the purposes
   of Rule 217, is the text of the rules as actually written, as
   agumented by the  semantic context of applicable definitions.
   Substituting definitions into the text of a rule cannot eliminate
   unclarity caused by ambiguous grammar or other linguistic aspects.

Rule 1030/13 (Power=3.2)
Precedence between Rules

      In a conflict between Rules, the conflict shall be resolved by
      performing the following comparisons in the sequence written in
      this rule, until the conflict is resolved.
      
      - In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
        the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
        Power; otherwise,
      
      - If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
        precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
        determining precedence relations, then the determinations of the
        precedence-determining Rule shall be used to resolve the
        conflicts; otherwise,
      
      - If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
        itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or takes
        precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
        provisions shall be used to resolve the conflict, unless they
        lead to contradictions between each other; otherwise,
      
      - If any of the rules in conflict have ID numbers, then the Rule
        with the lowest ID number takes precedence; otherwise,
      
      - The Rule enacted earliest takes precedence.
      
      Clauses in any other rule that broadly claim precedence (e.g. over
      "all rules" of a certain class) shall be, prima facie, considered
      to be limited claims of precedence or deference that are
      applicable only when such claims are evaluated as described within
      the above sequence.
      
      No change to the ruleset can occur that would cause a Rule to
      directly claim precedence over this Rule as a means of determining
      precedence. This applies to changes by the enactment or amendment
      of a Rule, or of any other form. This Rule takes precedence over
      any Rule that would permit such a change to the ruleset.

Annotations:
CFJ 1104 (called 20 Aug 1998): The presence in a Rule of deference
   clause, claiming that the Rule defers to another Rule, does not
   prevent a conflict with the other Rule arising, but shows only how
   the Rule says that conflict is to be resolved when it does arise.
CFJ 1114-1115 (called 27 Jan 1999): This Rule is to be applied to
   resolve Rule conflicts on a case-by-case basis; just because a Rule
   is inapplicable in one situation due to conflict with a Rule of
   higher precedence does not mean that the Rule is nullified in all
   cases.

Rule 105/21 (Power=3)
Rule Changes

      Where permitted by other rules, a statute generally can, as
      part of its effect,
      
      1. enact a rule. The new rule has power equal to the minimum of
         the power specified by the enacting statute, defaulting to
         one if the enacting statute does not specify or if it
         specifies a power less than 0.1, and the maximum power
         permitted by other rules. The enacting statute may specify a
         title for the new rule, which if present shall prevail. The ID
         number of the new rule cannot be specified by the enacting
         statute; any attempt to so specify is null and void.
      
      2. repeal a rule. When a rule is repealed, it ceases to be a rule,
         its power is set to 0, and the Rulekeepor need no longer
         maintain a record of it.
      
      3. reenact a rule. A repealed rule identified by its most recent
         rule number MUST be reenacted with the same ID number and the
         next change identifier. If no text is specified, the rule is
         reenacted with the same text it had when it was most recently
         repealed. If the reenacting proposal provides new text for the
         rule, the rule SHOULD have materially the same purpose as did
         the repealed version. Unless specified otherwise by the
         reenacting statute, a reenacted rule has power equal to
         the power it had at the time of its repeal (or power 1, if
         power was not defined at the time of that rule's repeal). If
         the reenacting statute is incapable of setting the
         reenacted rule's power to that value, then the reenactment is
         null and void.
      
      4. amend the text of a rule.
      
      5. retitle a rule.
      
      6. change the power of a rule.
      
      A rule change is any effect that falls into the above classes.
      Rule changes always occur sequentially, never simultaneously.
      
      Any ambiguity in the specification of a rule change causes that
      change to be void and without effect. An inconsequential variation
      in the quotation of an existing rule does not constitute ambiguity
      for the purposes of this rule, but any other variation does.
      
      A rule change is wholly prevented from taking effect unless its
      full text was published, along with an unambiguous and clear
      specification of the method to be used for changing the rule, at
      least 4 days and no more than 60 days before it would otherwise
      take effect.
      
      This rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be
      created, modified, or destroyed, or by which an entity can become
      a rule or cease to be a rule.

CFJ 1499 (called 20 Apr 2004): CFJ 1499 (called 20 Apr 2004), CFJ 1623
   (called 01 Apr 2007): If a low-power rule states that an officer can
   repeal the rule under certain circumstances, then the rule cannot
   actually be repealed by this process, because the officer, not being
   an instrument, is categorically incapable of performing rule changes;
   this is different from the situation where a rule can be triggered to
   repeal itself.
CFJ 708 (called between 01 Oct 1994 and 31 Oct 1994): An Amendment of a
   non-existing Rule is not a legal Rule Change.
CFJ 1625 (called 01 Apr 2007): Where a proposal specifies a rule to
   amend by both number and title, and the number and title given
   identify different rules, this constitutes ambiguity that nullifies
   the attempted rule change.
CFJ 1644 (called 29 Apr 2007): Where a proposal contains the form of
   words "Change the power of rule NNNN to P and amend it by XXX.",
   where XXX specifies a text change, this constitutes two attempted
   rule changes.
CFJ 1638 (called 29 Apr 2007): Where a proposal contains the form of
   words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX. Amend rule NNNN by YYY.", this
   constitutes two separate attempts at rule changes, even though both
   attempt to amend the same rule.
CFJ 1642 (called 29 Apr 2007): Where a proposal contains the form of
   words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX. Further amend rule NNNN by YYY.",
   where both XXX and YYY specify text changes, this constitutes two
   separate attempts at rule changes.
CFJ 1640 (called 29 Apr 2007): Where a proposal contains the form of
   words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX and YYY.", where both XXX and YYY
   specify text changes, this constitutes a single attempt at a rule
   change, even though it is specified in two parts.
CFJ 1641 (called 29 Apr 2007): Where a proposal contains the form of
   words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX and by YYY.", where both XXX and YYY
   specify text changes, this constitutes a single attempt at a rule
   change, even though it is specified in two parts.
CFJ 1643 (called 29 Apr 2007): Where a proposal specifies a single rule
   amendment in two parts, and one of the parts is not possible but the
   other is possible, the possible part is applied alone.
CFJ 2201 (called 30 Sep 2008): The permission required by Rule 105 need
   not be explicit.
CFJ 3830 (called 12 Apr 2020): Text in a rule cannot cause a rule-change
   after it has been deleted by an amendment.

Rule 2493/8 (Power=3)
Regulations

      A regulation is an textual entity defined as such by this rule,
      and under the authority of an person, known as its Promulgator. A
      regulation must be authorized by a rule (its parent rule) in order
      to exist. It has only the effect that rule explicitly gives it.
      
      A regulation CAN be enacted, amended, and repealed as specified by
      its parent rule. By default, a person CAN, with 2 Agoran consent,
      enact, amend, or repeal a regulation for which e is the
      Promulgator. Regulations are tracked by the Rulekeepor as part of
      eir weekly and monthly reports in a fashion similar to rules.

Rule 1681/23 (Power=1)
The Logical Rulesets

      The Short Logical Ruleset (SLR) is a format of the ruleset. In
      this format, each rule is assigned to a category, and the rules
      are grouped according to their category.
      
      Rules are assigned to, ordered within, or moved between
      categories, and categories are added, changed, or empty categories
      removed, as the Rulekeepor sees fit.
      
      The listing of each rule in the SLR must include the rule's ID
      number, revision number, power, title, and text.
      
      The Rulekeepor is strongly DISCOURAGED from including any
      additional information in the SLR, except that which increases the
      readability of the SLR.
      
      The Full Logical Ruleset (FLR) is a format of the ruleset. In this
      format, rules are assigned to the same category and presented in
      the same order as in the SLR. The FLR must contain all the
      information required to be in the SLR, and any historical
      annotations which the Rulekeepor is required to record.
      
      The Rulekeepor SHOULD also include any other information which e
      feels may be helpful in the use of the ruleset in the FLR.
      
      Whenever a rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeepor SHALL record
      and thereafter maintain a reasonably accurate historical
      annotation to the rule indicating:
      
      1. The type of change.
      
      2. The date on which the change took effect.
      
      3. The mechanism that specified the change.
      
      4. If the rule was changed due to a proposal, then that proposal's
         ID number, author, and coauthor(s) (if any).

Rule 107/21 (Power=3)
Initiating Agoran Decisions

      An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
      initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
      to initiate the decision. To be valid, the notice must clearly
      specify the following information:
      
      1. The matter to be decided (for example, "the adoption of
         proposal 4781");
      
      2. The voting method;
      
      3. A clear description of the valid options;
      
      4. The identity of the vote collector; and
      
      5. Any additional information defined by the rules as essential
         parameters.
      
      The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting period
      for the decision. The voting period lasts for 7 days. The minimum
      voting period for a decision with at least two options is five
      days. The vote collector for a decision with less than two options
      CAN and SHALL end the voting period by announcement, if it has not
      ended already, and provided that e resolves the decision in the
      same message.
      
      The voting period for a decision cannot be set or changed to a
      duration longer than fourteen days.
      
      A public notice purporting to initiate an Agoran decision is a
      self-ratifying attestation of the notice's validity.

Annotations:
CFJ 1650 (called 06 May 2007): The intent to initiate the decision and
   the information required in the notice need not be explicit.
CFJ 1743 (called 18 Sep 2007): If the notice does not mention voter
   eligibility but the type of Agoran decision is clear and the rule
   defining the relevant type of Agoran decision fully determines the
   class of eligible voters, then the notice thereby implicitly
   describes the class of eligible voters.
CFJ 1722 (called 15 Aug 2007): Information that is explicitly presented
   in the notice takes precedence over any information that would be
   implicit, even where the explicit information is inaccurate and the
   implicit information would have been accurate.
CFJ 1651 (called 06 May 2007): If a R107 notice initiating an Agoran
   decision does not contain an explicit list of the eligible voters,
   and there is later a dispute (evidenced by submission of a CFJ) over
   which voters were eligible at that time, then the notice's
   description of the class of eligible voters was necessarily
   insufficient to enable public agreement on which persons are
   eligible.
CFJ 1652 (called 06 May 2007): The set of eligible voters on an Agoran
   decision can change during its voting period.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2528/0 (Power=3)
Voting Methods

      Each Agoran decision has a voting method, which must be
      AI-majority, instant runoff, or first-past-the-post. The voting
      method is that specified by the authorizing authority, or
      first-past-the-post by default.
      
      Each Agoran decision has a set of valid options (the choices that
      the voters are being asked to select from) and valid votes (the
      ways in which the voters can express their opinion or lack
      thereof. For AI-majority decisions, the valid options are FOR and
      AGAINST; for other decisions, the valid options are defined by
      other rules.
      
      The valid votes on an Agoran decision are:
      
      1. PRESENT;
      
      2. The valid conditional votes, as defined by rules of power at
         least that of this rule; and
      
      3. For an instant runoff decision, the ordered lists of entities.
      
      4. For any other decision, the valid options.

Rule 683/26 (Power=3)
Voting on Agoran Decisions

      An entity submits a ballot on an Agoran decision by publishing a
      notice satisfying the following conditions:
      
      1. The ballot is submitted during the voting period for the
         decision.
      
      2. The entity casting the ballot (the voter) was, at the
         initiation of the decision, a player.
      
      3. The ballot clearly identifies the matter to be decided.
      
      4. The ballot clearly identifies a valid vote, as determined by
         the voting method.
      
      5. The ballot clearly sets forth the voter's intent to place
         the identified vote.
      
      6. The voter has no other valid ballots on the same decision.
      
      A valid ballot is a ballot, correctly submitted, that has not
      been withdrawn. During the voting period of an Agoran decision,
      an entity CAN by announcement withdraw (syn. retract) a ballot
      that e submitted on that decision. To "change" one's vote is to
      retract eir previous ballot (if any), then submit a new one.

CFJ 1852-1853 (called 23 Dec 2007): Claiming to submit more votes than
   ones voting limit on the decision does not constitute the making of a
   false statement.
CFJ 3647 (called 24 Jun 2018): To attempt to "vote in the same way as
   another player" is ambiguous, because it may refer to the other
   player's vote at the time of the message (an unconditional vote) or
   at the time of resolution (a conditional vote).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 208/14 (Power=3)
Resolving Agoran Decisions

      The vote collector for an unresolved Agoran decision CAN resolve
      it by announcement, indicating the outcome. If it was required to
      be initiated, then e SHALL resolve it in a timely fashion after
      the end of the voting period. To be EFFECTIVE, such an attempt
      must satisfy the following conditions:
      
      1. It is published after the voting period has ended.
      
      2. It clearly identifies the matter to be resolved.
      
      3. It specifies the number of voters (or a list of the voters).
         For these purposes and for determining quorum, a "voter" is
         someone who submitted a ballot on the decision that was valid
         when it was submitted and also valid (i.e. not withdrawn or
         otherwise invalidated) at the end of the voting period.
      
      4. It specifies the outcome, as described elsewhere, and, if there
         was more than one valid option, provides a tally of the voters'
         valid ballots.
      
      Each Agoran decision has exactly one vote collector, defaulting to
      the initiator of the decision. If the vote collector is defined by
      reference to a position (or, in the default case, if the initiator
      was so defined), then the vote collector is the current holder of
      that position.
      
      This rule takes precedence over any rule that would provide
      another mechanism by which an Agoran decision may be resolved.
      
      In general, changes to the gamestate due to the outcome of an
      Agoran decision take effect when the decision is resolved.

Rule 955/26 (Power=3)
Determining the Will of Agora

      Each Agoran decision has a voting method, which determines how
      voters may vote on it and how to calculate the outcome. The
      strength of a ballot is the voting strength of the voter who cast
      it on that Agoran decision.
      
      1. For an AI-majority decision, let F be the total strength of all
         valid ballots cast FOR a decision, A be the same for AGAINST,
         and AI be the adoption index of the decision. The outcome is
         ADOPTED if F/A >= AI and F/A > 1 (or F>0 and A=0), otherwise
         REJECTED.
      
      2. For an instant runoff decision, the outcome is whichever option
         wins according to the standard definition of instant runoff.
         For this purpose, a ballot of strength N is treated as if it
         were N distinct ballots expressing the same preferences. In
         case multiple valid options tie for the lowest number of votes
         at any stage, the vote collector CAN and must, in the
         announcement of the decision's resolution, select one such
         option to eliminate; if, for M > 1, all eir possible choices in
         the next M stages would result in the same set of options being
         eliminated, e need not specify the order of elimination. If an
         entity that is part of a valid vote is not a valid option at
         the end of the voting period, or disqualified by the rule
         providing for the decision, then that entity is eliminated
         prior to the first round of counting.
      
      3. For a first-past-the-post decision, the outcome is whichever
         option received the highest total strength of valid ballots. In
         case of a tie, the vote collector CAN and must, in the
         announcement of the decision's resolution, select one of the
         leaders as the outcome.
      
      The previous notwithstanding:
      
      - If there is more than one option, and the number of voters is
        less than the quorum of that decision, the outcome is instead
        FAILED QUORUM.
      
      - If there are no valid options, the outcome is null.
      
      The outcome of a decision is determined when it is resolved, and
      cannot change thereafter.

Annotations:
CFJ 1673-1675 (called 20 May 2007): Quorum for an Agoran decision is
   determined at the time the vote collector makes the calculations
   described in Rule 955.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 879/39 (Power=2)
Quorum

      Each Agoran decision has a quorum. This is a number set when the
      decision is created, and thereafter cannot be changed. When a
      person initiates an Agoran decision, that person SHALL state the
      quorum of that decision. However, incorrectly stating the quorum
      of a decision does not invalidate the initiation, nor does it
      actually change the quorum of the decision.
      
      The quorum that an Agoran decision gains as it is created can be
      defined by other rules of power 2 or greater. If no other rule
      defines the quorum of an Agoran decision, the quorum for that
      decision is equal to 2/3 of the number of voters on the referendum
      that had been most recently resolved at the time of that
      decision's initiation, the whole rounded to the nearest integer.
      
      As an exception to the previous paragraph, the quorum of an
      Agoran decision can never be less than 2. If the rules would
      attempt to set the quorum of an Agoran decision to less than 2,
      it is set to 2 instead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2422/7 (Power=3)
Voting Strength

      The voting strength of an entity on an Agoran decision is an
      integer between 0 and 15 inclusive, defined by rules of power 2
      or greater. If not otherwise specified, the voting strength of
      an entity on an Agoran decision is 3.
      
      When multiple rules set or modify an entity's voting strength on
      an Agoran decision, it shall be determined by first applying the
      rule(s) which set it to a specific value, using the ordinary
      precedence of rules, and then applying the rules, other than
      this one, which modify it, in numerical order by ID. Finally, if
      the result of the calculation is not an integer, it is rounded
      up, and then if it is outside the allowable range of values for
      voting strength, it is set to the minimum value if it was less
      and the maximum value if it was more.
      
      A player CAN Buy Strength by paying 1 Extra Vote and specifying a
      current Agoran decision on which e is a voter. For each time a
      player has Bought Strength on a decision, eir voting strength is 1
      greater on that decision. A player CANNOT Buy Strength for the
      same decision more than 3 times.

Rule 2127/11 (Power=3)
Conditional Votes

      A conditional vote on an Agoran decision is a vote which indicates
      a vote based on some condition(s). A conditional vote is evaluated
      at the end of the voting period and, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, is clearly specified if and only if the value of
      the condition(s) is/are determinate at the end of the voting
      period. If the conditional is clearly specified, and evaluates to
      a valid vote, it is counted as that vote; otherwise, it is counted
      as PRESENT.
      
      Any vote which is clearly expressed as a conditional, e.g. "FOR if
      <X> is true, AGAINST otherwise", is a valid conditional vote that
      evaluates as specified.
      
      A vote endorsing another person is equivalent to a conditional
      vote evaluating to the vote specified in that person's valid
      ballot on the decision, if any.
      
      For an instant runoff decision, a vote consisting of a list, one
      or more entries of which are valid conditional votes, and the
      remaining entries of which are valid options, is a valid
      conditional vote. Such a vote is evaluated by evaluating each
      conditional entry to a list of votes (or an empty list, if it
      evaluates to PRESENT either directly or indirectly), and then
      concatenating those lists with the specified valid options in the
      order they occurred in the original vote.

Rule 2168/8 (Power=1)
Extending the Voting Period

      Whenever the voting period of an Agoran decision would end, and
      the result would be FAILED QUORUM, the length of the voting period
      for that decision is instead increased to 14 days, except if it is
      already that length, provided this has not already happened for
      the decision in question.
      
      Upon such an occurrence, the vote collector for the decision SHALL
      issue a humiliating public reminder naming the slackers who have
      not yet cast any votes on it despite being eligible, and CAN end
      its voting period by announcement (resolving it constitutes an
      implicit announcement that its voting period is first ended) if
      the result would no longer be FAILED QUORUM, or if the decision is
      a referendum on a proposal and no voter (other than possibly the
      proposal's author) has voted FOR.

Rule 1950/36 (Power=3)
Decisions with Adoption Indices

      Adoption index (AI) is an untracked switch possessed by Agoran
      decisions and proposals, secured at power 2.  For decisions, the
      possible values are "none" (default) or integral multiples of 0.1
      from 1.0 to 9.9. For proposals, the possible values are integral
      multiples of 0.1 from 1.0 to 9.9 (default 1.0).
      
      Adoption index is secured with a Power Threshold of 2.
      
      Adoption index is an essential parameter of an Agoran decision if
      that decision has an adoption index.
      
      For any Agoran decision with an adoption index, the voting method
      is AI-majority.

Offices & Reporting
   Players who hold offices have control over and track various
   different mechanics. These rules govern the special
   responsibilities that officers have.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1006/44 (Power=2)
Offices

      An Office is a position described as an Office by the Rules.
      Officeholder is an office switch tracked by the ADoP, with
      possible values of any person or "vacant" (default). An officer is
      the holder of an office, who may be referred to by the name of
      that office. If the holder of an office is ever not a player, it
      becomes vacant.
      
      An imposed office is an office described as such by the rule
      defining it. All others are elected. A person CANNOT be made the
      holder of an elected office without eir explicit or reasonably
      implied consent.
      
      A holder of an elected office who did not become its holder by
      winning an election, and has not won an election for that office
      since, is an interim holder. An elected office that is either
      vacant or has an interim holder is an interim office.
      
      The holder of an elected office CAN resign it by announcement,
      causing it to become vacant. The non-interim holder of an elected
      office CAN, with 3 support, resign the office while appointing
      another player to become the holder of the office, provided that
      other player is one of the Supporters. Any player CAN cause an
      office to become vacant without 2 objections.
      
      When a proposal takes effect and creates a new office, if the
      proposal does not specify otherwise, the author of that proposal
      becomes the holder of the office.

CFJ 1660 (called 13 May 2007): This rule does not define the meaning of
   the term "office", in the sense meant by Rule 754, but rather
   references the usual English definition of "office" and governs
   offices as thus defined.
CFJ 1702 (called 12 Jul 2007): A requirement to submit something to an
   officer is satisfied by publishing it, even if that office is vacant
   at the time.

Rule 2630/1 (Power=2.0)
The Administrative State

      Each officer CAN, with 1.5 Agoran consent, enact, amend, or repeal
      eir own office's Administrative Regulations. If e has won an
      election for the office in the last 7 days, e CAN repeal them by
      announcement.  Administrative Regulations have the following
      properties:
      
      1. An officer SHALL NOT violate eir office's administrative
         regulations in the discharge of eir office.
      2. Any player CAN act on behalf of an officer to exercise eir
         official powers as authorized by eir office's administrative
         regulations.
      3. All players SHOULD abide by an officer's administrative
         regulations in matters relating to eir area of responsibility.

Rule 2154/59 (Power=2)
Election Procedure

      A player CAN initiate an election for a specified elected office:
      
      a) with 2 support, if either the office is interim or the most
         recent election for that office was resolved more than 90 days
         prior, and provided that the initiator becomes a candidate in
         the same message.
      
      b) By announcement, if e is the ADoP and if the office is interim,
         or if e is the holder of that office.
      
      The above notwithstanding, an election for an office CANNOT be
      initiated if one is already in progress.
      
      When an election is initiated, it enters the nomination period,
      which lasts for 4 days. After an election is initiated and until
      nominations close, any player CAN become a candidate by
      announcement. A candidate ceases to be a candidate if e ceases to
      be a player during the election or if holding the office would
      make em Overpowered. During the nomination period, a candidate CAN
      cease to be a candidate by announcement if there is at least one
      other candidate.
      
      An election whose nomination period is complete is contested if it
      has two or more candidates, and uncontested otherwise. Nominations
      close at the end of the poll's voting period or when the election
      is ended, whichever comes first.
      
      After the nomination period ends, the ADoP CAN and, in a timely
      fashion, SHALL:
      
      1) If the election is contested, initiate an Agoran decision to
         select the winner of the election (the poll). For this
         decision, the Vote Collector is the ADoP, the valid options are
         the candidates for that election (including those who become
         candidates after its initiation), and the voting method is
         instant runoff. When the poll is resolved, its outcome, if a
         player, wins the election. If the outcome is not a player, the
         election ends with no winner.
      
      2) If POSSIBLE per the following paragraph, end the election
         immediately.
      
      If at any point an uncontested election has a single candidate,
      then any player CAN by announcement declare em the winner of the
      election, thereby causing em to win the election. If at any point
      an uncontested election has no candidates, then any player CAN
      declare the election ended with no winner by announcement.
      
      When a player wins an election, e is installed into the associated
      office and the election ends.

Deputisation

      A player acting as emself (the deputy) CAN perform an action
      ordinarily reserved for an office-holder as if e held the office
      if
      
      1. the rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of
         holding that office, to perform the action (this requirement is
         fulfilled by the deputy performing the action);
      
      2. it would be POSSIBLE for the deputy to perform the action,
         other than by deputisation, if e held the office;
      
      3. either (i) a time limit by which the rules require the action
         to be performed has expired or (ii) the office is vacant;
      
      4. either (i) the office is vacant, (ii) the aforementioned time
         limit expired more than fourteen days ago, or (iii) the deputy
         announced between two and fourteen days earlier that e intended
         to deputise for that office for the purposes of the particular
         action; and
      
      5. the deputy, when performing the action, announces that e is
         doing so by deputisation or by temporary deputisation
      
      When a player deputises for an elected office, e becomes the
      holder of that office, unless the action being performed would
      already install someone into that office, and/or unless the
      deputisation is temporary.

CFJ 1776 (called 01 Nov 2007): A requirement to perform an action, for
   the purposes of this rule, can be a logical implication from rules
   and circumstances, not just directly imposed by the rules. In
   particular, it is possible to deputise to rotate the bench.
CFJ 2400 (called 06 Mar 2009): Deputisation is generally treated as if
   the deputy gained the office immediately before the action, and lost
   it immediately after.
CFJ 3739 (called 16 Jun 2019): To perform an action by temporary
   deputisation is to deputise.

      2. Promotor and Assessor
      
      3. Assessor and ADoP
      
      4. Referee and Arbitor
      
      A player is Overpowered if e holds two offices which are
      incompatible with each other. Rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, a player CANNOT be installed into an office if
      doing so would make em Overpowered.
      
      A zombie is Overpowered if e holds one or more offices.
      
      If a player is Overpowered, any player CAN, with Notice, Demand
      Resignation from em. When this occurs, each office that the
      Overpowered player holds becomes vacant.

Documents
   Documents are little bits of text that can be ratified, therefore
   modifying the gamestate slightly.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1551/21 (Power=3.1)
Ratification

      When a document or statement (hereafter "document") is ratified,
      rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the gamestate is modified
      to what it would be if, at the time the ratified document was
      published, the gamestate had been minimally modified to make the
      ratified document as true and accurate as possible; however, if
      the document explicitly specifies a different past time as being
      the time the document was true, the specified time is used to
      determine the minimal modifications. Such a modification cannot
      add inconsistencies between the gamestate and the rules, and it
      cannot include rule changes unless the ratified document
      explicitly and unambiguously recites either the changes or the
      resulting properties of the rule(s). If no such modification is
      possible, or multiple substantially distinct possible
      modifications would be equally appropriate, the ratification
      fails.
      
      An internally inconsistent document generally cannot be ratified;
      however, if such a document can be divided into a summary section
      and a main section, where the only purpose of the summary section
      is to summarize information in the main section, and the main
      section is internally consistent, ratification of the document
      proceeds as if it contained only the main section.
      
      Text purportedly about previous instances of ratification (e.g. a
      report's date of last ratification) is excluded from ratification.
      The rules may define additional information that is considered to
      be part of the document for the purposes of ratification; such
      definitions are secured at a Power Threshold of 3.
      
      Ratification is secured with Power Threshold 3.

Rule 2201/10 (Power=3)
Self-Ratification

      When a public document is continuously undoubted for one week
      after publication:
      
      - If the rules define it as self-ratifying, it is ratified.
      
      - If the rules define it as a self-ratifying attestation to a
        given statement, the statement is ratified.
      
        This clause is inapplicable if the statement to be ratified
        cannot be reasonably ascertained from the ruleset and the
        contents of the message.
      
      Any person CAN by announcement issue a doubt (syn. claim of
      error), identifying a document and explaining the scope and nature
      of a perceived error in it (or in a statement it attests to).
      
      When this happens, the publisher of the original document SHALL
      (if e was required to publish that document) or SHOULD (otherwise)
      do one of the following in a timely fashion, in an announcement
      that clearly cites the claim of error:
      
         1. Deny the claim (causing it to cease to be a doubt).
      
         2. Publish a revision.
      
         3. Initiate an inquiry case regarding the truth of the claim
            (if the subject is actually a matter of law), or cite a
            relevant existing inquiry case.

Rule 2478/14 (Power=1.7)
Vigilante Justice

      A player CAN by announcement, but subject to the provisions of
      this rule, Point eir Finger at a person (the perp) who plays the
      game; the announcement has to explicitly name the perp and cite a
      specific rule and an alleged violation of that rule by that
      person.
      
      When a player Points a Finger, the investigator SHALL investigate
      the allegation and CAN, and in a timely fashion SHALL, conclude
      the investigation by:
      
      - Issuing a Warning to the perp, as described elsewhere;
      
      - Imposing the Cold Hand of Justice on the perp for the cited rule
        violation, as described elsewhere;
      
      - Issuing an Indictment against the perp for the cited rule
        violation, as described elsewhere; or
      
      - if e believes that no rules violation occurred or that it would
        be ILLEGAL or INEFFECTIVE to levy a fine for it, announcing the
        Finger Pointing to be Shenanigans.
      
      Initiating a Finger Pointing found to be Shenanigans is ILLEGAL
      and the Class 0+N Crime of Unjustified Gesticulation, where N is
      the number of times e has previously committed the crime in the
      current Agoran Week.
      
      The above notwithstanding, the investigator CANNOT resolve a
      Finger Pointing for which e is the perp.
      
      The Referee is by default the investigator for all Finger
      Pointing. If the Referee is the perp, then the Arbitor CAN
      become the investigator of that Finger Pointing by announcement.
      
      The Referee CANNOT Point eir Finger. The Arbitor CANNOT Point eir
      Finger at the Referee. A high crime is any crime specified as
      being class 4 or greater. The Referee CANNOT levy the Cold Hand of
      Justice to punish a high crime, notwithstanding Rule 2478.
      
      The player who initiated the most Finger Pointings that resulted
      in a Warning, Indictment, or Cold Hand of Justice in the previous
      Agoran Week CAN once grant emself a Justice Card by announcement.

Official Injustice

Rule 2557/5 (Power=1.7)
Sentencing Guidelines

      When the rules authorize an investigator to impose the Cold Hand
      of Justice for a violation, e CAN do so by levying a fine of B on
      the perp by announcement, within the following guidelines:
      
      - B is at least 1 and at most twice the base value of the
        violation.
      
      - If the violation is described by the rules as a "Class N Crime"
        (where N is a positive integer, or an expression that evaluates
        to a positive integer), then N is the base value; otherwise the
        base value is 2.
      
      - The fine SHOULD be reduced to the degree that the violation is a
        minor, accidental, and/or inconsequential infraction.
      
      - The fine SHOULD be increased to the degree that the violation is
        willful, profitable, egregious, or an abuse of an official
        position.
      
      Optionally, in the same message in which e imposes justice, the
      investigator CAN specify that the violation is forgivable,
      specifying up to 10 words to be included in an apology.  If the
      investigator does so, the perp CAN, in a timely fashion, expunge P
      blots from emself, where P is the value of the fine, by publishing
      a formal apology of at least 200 words and including all the
      specified words, explaining eir error, shame, remorse, and ardent
      desire for self-improvement.
      
      When the rules authorize an investigator to issue a Warning for a
      violation, e CAN do so by announcement if the violation is
      described by the rules as a "Class N Crime" where N is 0 or an
      expression that evaluates to 0.

Rule 2619/3 (Power=1.0)
Indictment

      When the rules authorize an investigator to issue an Indictment
      for a violation, e CAN do so by announcement, specifying a fine of
      blots to be issued and the perpetrator and making an argument for
      the conviction of the accused.
      
      When an investigator has issued an Indictment, the perpetrator CAN
      state a defence. Within 10 days but no less than 4 days after the
      indictment has been issued, the judge CAN and SHALL initiate two
      Agoran Decisions, one to determine whether to convict the
      perpetrator and one to determine whether to accept the indictment.
      For these decision, the vote collector is the Judge and the voting
      method is AI-majority with AI=1.5. When initiating the decisions,
      the Judge SHALL, in the same message, publish the full texts of
      the Indictment and the defence. If both decisions are resolved as
      ADOPTED, the investigator CAN, by announcement, and SHALL impose
      the fine stated in the indictment. If the decision to convict is
      resolved as ADOPTED but the decision to accept is resolved as
      REJECTED, the investigator CAN issue a new Indictment. If the
      decision to convict is resolved as REJECTED, a fine SHALL NOT be
      imposed for the crime stated in the indictment.
      
      The Judge of the Indictment is the first of the following players
      who is neither the investigator nor the perp: the Arbitor, the
      Speaker, the Prime Minister. If this still fails to specify a
      player, then the Indictment lacks a Judge until that changes.
      
      If it would be ILLEGAL or INEFFECTIVE for the Investigator to levy
      a fine for the stated crime, all decisions associated with the
      Indictment cease to exist, and the Judge and Investigator are
      freed of any obligations of this rule.

        (1) it does not include value of the fine in blots, the name of
            the person being fined (the perp), and the specific reason

Calls for Judgement
   What if there is a rule conflict? What if we can't decide what a rule
   means? Well then, it's time to call a CFJ.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 991/33 (Power=2)
Calls for Judgement

      Any person (the initiator) can initiate a Call for Judgement (CFJ,
      syn. Judicial Case), specifying a statement to be inquired into by
      announcement.
      
      When a person initiates a Call for Judgement, e CAN optionally bar
      one person from the case by announcement.
      
      At any time, each CFJ is either open (default), suspended, or
      assigned exactly one judgement that was validly assigned.
      
      The Arbitor is an office, responsible for the administration of
      justice in a manner that is fair for emself, if not for the rest
      of Agora.
      
      Judge is an untracked CFJ switch with possible values of any
      person or former person, or "unassigned" (default). To "assign" a
      CFJ to a person is to flip that CFJ's judge to that person.  To
      "remove" or "recuse" a person from a being the judge of a CFJ is
      to flip that CFJ's judge from that person to unassigned.
      
      When an open CFJ's judge is unassigned, the Arbitor CAN assign any
      eligible player to be its judge by announcement, and SHALL do so
      in a timely fashion after it becomes an open and unassigned CFJ.
      The players eligible to be assigned as judge are all active
      players except the initiator and the person barred (if any). The
      Arbitor SHALL assign judges over time such that all interested
      players have reasonably equal opportunities to judge.  If a CFJ
      has no judge assigned, then any player eligible to judge that CFJ
      CAN assign it to emself without 3 objections.
      
      The Arbitor's weekly report includes a summary of recent judicial
      case activity, including open and recently-judged cases, recent
      judicial assignments, and a list of players interested in judging.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 591/47 (Power=1.7)
Delivering Judgements

      When a CFJ is open and assigned to a judge, that judge CAN assign
      a valid judgement to it by announcement, and SHALL do so in a
      timely fashion after this becomes possible.
      
      The valid judgements for an inquiry case are as follows, based on
      the facts and legal situation at the time the inquiry case was
      initiated, not taking into account any events since that time:
      
      * FALSE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
        logically false
      
      * TRUE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
        logically true
      
      * IRRELEVANT, appropriate if the veracity of the statement is
        not relevant to the game or is an overly hypothetical
        extrapolation of the game or its rules to conditions that don't
        actually exist, or if it can be trivially determined from the
        outcome of another (possibly still undecided) judicial case that
        was not itself judged IRRELEVANT
      
      * INSUFFICIENT, appropriate if the statement does not come
        with supporting arguments or evidence, and the judge feels as if
        an undue burden is being placed on em by the lack of arguments
        and evidence. A CFJ judged as INSUFFICIENT CAN and SHOULD be
        submitted again with sufficient arguments/evidence.
      
      * DISMISS, appropriate if the statement is malformed, undecidable,
        if insufficient information exists to make a judgement with
        reasonable effort, or the statement is otherwise not able to be
        answered with another valid judgement. DISMISS is not
        appropriate if PARADOXICAL is appropriate.
      
      * PARADOXICAL, appropriate if the statement is logically
        undecidable as a result of a paradox or or other irresovable
        logical situation. PARADOXICAL is not appropriate if IRRELEVANT
        is appropriate, nor is it appropriate if the undecidability
        arises from the case itself or in reference to it.
      
      If the judge of an open CFJ has not violated a time limit for
      assigning it a judgement, and has not previously filed a motion to
      either extend or reconsider the case, e CAN file a motion to
      extend the case by announcement. Doing so extends eir judgement
      deadline for that case by one week. In doing so, e SHOULD include
      a (nonbinding) draft or outline of eir current thoughts on the
      case.

Annotations:
CFJ 1835 (called 18 Dec 2007): A question cannot generally take the
   place of a statement in initiating an inquiry case.
CFJ 1903 (called 06 Feb 2008): The question-statement equivalence
   established by this rule applies only for the purposes of the subject
   of an inquiry case, not for acting by announcement.
CFJ 1671 (called 17 May 2007): The truth or falsity of a statement can
   be determined as of the initiation of a CFJ even if public knowledge
   at the time of initiation was not sufficient to determine it.
CFJ 1482 (called 10 Feb 2004): If the truth of a CFJ statement logically
   depends on the truth of statements of a previously-called CFJ which
   has not yet been judged, the judge is entitled to treat this as a
   situation of insufficient information being available.
CFJ 1744 (called 18 Sep 2007): It is not the job of the judge to hunt
   down or request the information that would be required to render a
   substantive judgement.
CFJ 1771 (called 28 Oct 2007): If an inquiry case revolves around the
   interpretation of a specific message, and the initiator does not
   provide a reasonable reference to that message , the judge is
   entitled to treat this as a situation of insufficient information
   being available.
CFJ 1732 (called 23 Aug 2007): If a particular player holds a particular
   office, and an inquiry case on a statement that that player holds
   that office is judged FALSE, that player still holds that office.
CFJ 2281 (called 19 Nov 2008): For the purposes of determining the
   validity of an inquiry case, the term "statement" should be
   interpreted loosely.

Rule 911/55 (Power=1.7)
Motions and Moots

      If a judgement has been in effect for less then seven days and has
      not been entered into Moot, then:
      
      - The judge of that CFJ CAN self-file a Motion to Reconsider the
        case by announcement, if e has not already self-filed a Motion
        to Reconsider that CFJ.
      - Any Player CAN group-file a Motion to Reconsider the case with 2
        support, if the CFJ has not had a Motion to Reconsider
        group-filed for it at any time while it has been assigned to its
        current judge.
      
      When a Motion to Reconsider is so filed, the case is rendered open
      again.
      
      If a CFJ has a judgement assigned, a player CAN enter that
      judgement into Moot with N+2 support, where N is the number of
      weeks since that judgement has been assigned, rounded down. When
      this occurs, the CFJ is suspended, and the Arbitor is once
      authorized to initiate the Agoran decision to determine public
      confidence in the judgement, which e SHALL do in a timely fashion.
      
      For this decision, the vote collector is the Arbitor and the valid
      options are AFFIRM, REMAND, and REMIT. When the decision is
      resolved, the effect depends on the outcome:
      
      - AFFIRM, FAILED QUORUM: The judgement is reassigned to the case,
        and cannot be entered into Moot again.
      
      - REMAND: The case becomes open again.
      
      - REMIT: The case becomes open again, and the current judge is
        recused. The Arbitor SHALL NOT assign em to the case again
        unless no other eligible judges have displayed interest in
        judging.

Rule 2175/9 (Power=1)
Judicial Retraction and Excess

      A new case is a judicial case that has not had any judge assigned
      to it. The initiator of a new case CAN retract it by announcement,
      thus causing it to cease to be a judicial case.
      
      An excess case is a new case whose initiator previously initiated
      five or more cases during the same week as that case. A person
      SHALL NOT initiate an excess case. The Arbitor CAN refuse an
      excess case by announcement, thus causing it to cease to be a
      judicial case. When e does so, e fulfills any obligations with
      regards to that case.

Rule 2246/6 (Power=2)
Submitting a CFJ to the Referee

      When a person initiates a Call for Judgement, e CAN, optionally,
      submit it to the Referee by announcement. All persons are
      ENCOURAGED to submit a case to the Referee only when there is a
      good reason not to let it be processed by the Arbitor as usual.
      
      When a CFJ is submitted to the Referee, the Referee receives all
      obligations and powers for the specific case that the Arbitor
      would otherwise receive due to being Arbitor.  This takes
      precedence over Rules that would otherwise assign duties and
      powers regarding a judicial case to the Arbitor.

Rule 2471/1 (Power=1)
No Faking

      A person SHALL NOT make a public statement that is a lie. A
      statment is a lie if its publisher either knew or believed it to
      be not to be true at the time e published it (or, in the case of
      an action, not to be effective), and it was made with the intent
      to mislead. Merely quoting a statement does not constitute making
      it for the purposes of this rule. Any disclaimer, conditional
      clause, or other qualifier attached to a statement constitutes
      part of the statement for the purposes of this rule; the truth or
      falsity of the whole is what is significant.
      
      The previous provisions of this rule notwithstanding, a formal
      announcement of intent is never a lie.

Rule 2450/9 (Power=1.7)
Pledges

      If a Player makes a clear public pledge (syn. Oath) to perform (or
      refrain from performing) certain actions, then breaking the pledge
      within the pledge's time window is the Class N crime of
      Oathbreaking, where N is 2 unless the pledge explicitly states
      otherwise. It is also Oathbreaking for a player to let a pledge
      expire without taking an action e pledged to do in that pledge.
      The time window of a pledge is 60 days, unless the pledge
      explicitly states otherwise. A pledge ceases to exist at the end
      of its time window.
      
      If breaking the pledge harms specific other parties, the Referee
      SHOULD solicit the opinion of those parties in determining an
      appropriate fine.
      
      The Notary CAN destroy a pledge Without Objection, but SHOULD NOT
      do so unless the pledge no longer serves any significant purpose.

Rule 2466/2 (Power=3)
Acting on Behalf

      When a rule allows one person (the agent) to act on behalf of
      another (the principal) to perform an action, that agent CAN
      perform the action if it is POSSIBLE for the principal to do so,
      taking into account any prerequisites for the action. If the
      enabling rule does not specify the mechanism by which the agent
      may do so, then the agent CAN perform the action in the same
      manner in which the principal CAN do so, with the additional
      requirement that the agent must, in the message in which the
      action is performed, uniquely identify the principal and that the
      action is being taken on behalf of that person.
      
      A person SHALL NOT act on behalf of another person if doing so
      causes the second person to violate the rules. A person CANNOT act
      on behalf of another person to do anything except perform a game
      action; in particular, a person CANNOT act on behalf of another
      person to send a message, only to perform specific actions that
      might be taken within a message, including actions that would
      otherwise be taken by publishing certain text.
      
      When an action is performed on behalf of a principal, then the
      action is considered for all game purposes to have been performed
      by the principal, unless a rule specifically states that it is
      treated differently for some purpose, in which case it is treated
      as described by that rule.
      
      Allowing a person to act on behalf of another person is secured at
      power 2.0. This rule takes precedence over any rule that would
      prohibit a person from taking an action, except that it defers to
      any rule that imposes limitations specifically on actions taken on
      behalf of another person.

Rule 2618/1 (Power=2.2)
Promises

      Promises are a class of assets, tracked by the Notary. Their
      essential attributes are their text and creator. A person CAN, by
      announcement, grant emself a promise, specifying its text and
      becoming its creator. A promise's owner is referred to as its
      bearer. Promises with the same text, creator, and bearer are
      fungible. Promises with the same text and creator SHOULD be
      referred to by the same title, but the title is not an essential
      attribute of the promise, just a way of referring to it.
      
      A promise's bearer CAN, by announcement, cash the promise,
      provided that any conditions for cashing it specified by its text
      are unambiguously met. By doing so, e acts on the creator of the
      promise's behalf, causing the creator to act as if e published the
      promise's text, and destroys the promise. The bearer SHOULD recite
      the promise's essential attributes in the same message e cashes
      it.
      
      In a promise's text, "the bearer" (or the like) refers to the
      promise's bearer, and "this promise" (or the like) refers to the
      promise. The text of the promise can refer to the context of the
      message in which it is cashed, but the context of the message does
      not otherwise change the meaning of the promise.
      
      The Library is an entity and CAN own promises. Any player CAN take
      a specified promise from the Library by announcement, provided e
      cashes the promise in the same message. Any player CAN revoke a
      specified promise from the Library without objection.

Rule 1742/22 (Power=2.5)
Contracts

      Any group of one or more consenting persons (the parties) may
      publicly make an agreement among themselves with the intention
      that it be binding upon them and be governed by the rules. Such
      an agreement is known as a contract. A contract may be modified,
      including by changing the set of parties, with the consent of all
      existing parties. A contract may also be terminated with the
      consent of all parties. A contract automatically terminates if the
      number of parties to it falls below one. It is IMPOSSIBLE for a
      person to become a party to a contract without eir consent.
      
      Parties to a contract governed by the rules SHALL act in
      accordance with that contract. This obligation is not impaired
      by contradiction between the contract and any other contract, or
      between the contract and the rules.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any change that would cause
      the full provisions or parties of a contract to become publicly
      unavailable is canceled and does not take effect.
      
      The portion of a contract's provisions that can be interpreted
      with reference only to information that is either publicly or
      generally available are known as its body; the remainder of the
      provisions are known as the annex.
      
      A party to a contract CAN perform any of the following actions as
      explicitly and unambiguously permitted by the contract's body:
      
      * Act on behalf of another party to the contract.
      
      * By announcement, revoke destructible assets from the contract.
      
      * By announcement, transfer liquid assets from the contract to a
        specified recipient.

Rule 2631/0 (Power=1.0)
Charities

      Donation Level is a natural switch for contracts, tracked by the
      Notary, with a default of 0 and a maximum of 25. A contract with
      nonzero donation level is called a Charity.
      
      The Notary CAN flip a contract's donation level to a non-default
      value with 3 Agoran consent. This SHOULD only be done if the
      contract's provisions ensure that its funds received from Agora
      will be used solely for the betterment of Agora. Any player CAN
      flip a contract's donation level to 0 with Agoran consent.
      
      Whenever a payday occurs, half of each charity's coin holdings
      (rounded down) are destroyed, and then each charity earns a number
      of coins equal to its donation level.

Assets
   Assets are things players can own. This section describes how that
   works.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2166/30 (Power=3)
Assets

      An asset is an entity defined as such by a document that has been
      granted Mint Authority by the Rules (hereafter the asset's backing
      document), and existing solely because its backing document
      defines its existence. An asset's backing document can generally
      specify when and how that asset is created, destroyed, and
      transferred.
      
      The rules collectively have Mint Authority. Contracts have Mint
      Authority. An asset defined by rule or regulation is public; any
      other asset is private.
      
      The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity (if any)
      defined as such by, and bound by, its backing document. That
      entity's report includes a list of all instances of that class and
      their owners. This portion of that entity's report is
      self-ratifying.
      
      For a class of assets to be "tracked by" an entity is for that
      entity to be its recordkeepor.

Rule 2576/2 (Power=3)
Ownership

      Each asset has exactly one owner.
      
      If ownership of an asset is restricted to a class of entities,
      then that asset CANNOT be gained by or transferred to an entity
      outside that class. By default, ownership of an asset is
      restricted to Agora, players, and contracts, but an asset's
      backing document may modify this.
      
      If an asset's owner would otherwise be nonexistent, indeterminate,
      or invalid, then it is owned by the Lost and Found Department (if
      possible) or destroyed (otherwise), subject to modification by its
      backing document. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the Lost
      and Found Department can own assets of every type. Assets owned by
      the Lost and Found Department can be transferred or destroyed by
      any player without objection.

Rule 2577/2 (Power=3)
Asset Actions

      An asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner by announcement,
      subject to modification by its backing document. An indestructible
      asset is one defined as such by its backing document, and CANNOT
      be destroyed except as explicitly specified by its backing
      document; any other asset is destructible.
      
      For an entity to earn an asset is for that asset to be created in
      that entity's possession. To grant an entity an asset is to create
      it in eir possession.
      
      For an entity to lose an asset is for that asset to be destroyed
      from that entity's possession. To revoke an asset from an entity
      is to destroy it from that entity's possession.
      
      For entity A to take an asset from entity B is to transfer it from
      entity B to entity A.
      
      An asset generally CAN be transferred (syn. given) by announcement
      by its owner to another entity, subject to modification by its
      backing document. A fixed asset is one defined as such by its
      backing document, and CANNOT be transferred; any other asset is
      liquid.
      
      When a rule indicates transferring an amount that is not a natural
      number, the specified amount is rounded up to the nearest natural
      number.

Currencies

      A currency is a class of asset defined as such by its backing

      The "x balance of an entity", where x is a currency, is the number
      of x that entity possesses. Where it resolves ambiguity, the asset
      or currency being referred to is the currency designated as

Rule 2579/2 (Power=3)
Fee-based Actions

      If the Rules associate payment of a set of assets (hereafter the
      fee for the action; syns: cost, price, charge) with performing an
      action, that method for performing that action is a fee-based
      method.
      
      If the fee is a non-integer quantity of a fungible asset, the
      actual fee is the next highest integer amount of that asset.
      
      To use a fee-based method, an entity (the Actor) who is otherwise
      permitted to perform the action must announce that e is performing
      the action; the announcement must specify the correct set of
      assets for the fee and indicate intent to pay that fee for the
      sole purpose of using that method to perform that action.
      
      Upon such an announcement:
      
        - If the Rules specify a recipient for the fee, and the Actor
          CAN transfer that specified fee from emself to the recipient,
          then that fee is transferred from the Actor to the recipient
          and the action is performed simultaneously;
      
        - If the Rules do not specify a recipient, and the Actor CAN
          destroy the specified fee in eir possession, then that fee in
          eir possession is destroyed and the action is performed
          simultaneously.
      
        - Otherwise, no changes are made to asset holdings and the
          action is not performed.
      
      If a Rule purports to provide a fee-based method to perform an
      action with a fee of no assets, that Rule enables the performance
      of the action by announcement. When using such a method, the actor
      SHOULD announce that there was a 0 or empty fee.

Rule 2545/3 (Power=2)
Auctions

      An auction is a way for entities to give away specified assets
      (items), grouped into lots, in exchange for a currency. A lot is a
      non-empty list of items to be transferred to a single recipient
      (an auction winner).
      
      When the rules authorize a person (the auctioneer) to conduct an
      auction, e CAN do so by any wholly public method that would be
      generally recognizable, as specified by the auctioneer at the
      start of the auction, and under common definitions and terms used
      in auctions, as a fair, equitable, and timely means of determining
      the auction winners from among the current players, and enabling
      the appropriate exchange of goods.
      
      The rule that authorizes the auction further authorizes the
      auctioneer or auction winners to transfer said items as necessary
      to conduct the auction in a manner consistent with the auction
      method. If the authorization is to auction "new" items, it further
      authorizes the creation of said items as per the chosen method.
      
      The Treasuror is the promulgator for regulations that define
      specific auction methods (i.e. "the default auction method") and
      SHOULD do in order to aid trade and commerce.  For the purposes of
      interpreting auction definitions, such methods are treated as if
      they are defined in this rule. To further aid trade and commerce,
      auction methods should be interpreted in the name of fairness with
      deference to the method's clear intent, if intent can be
      reasonably inferred.

Rule 2532/9 (Power=2)
Zombies

      A talisman is an indestructible asset, tracked by the Registrar,
      and with ownership wholly restricted to players and Agora. There
      exists exactly one talisman for each player, and no other
      talismans; if one does not exist for a certain player, it is
      created in eir posession.  Talismans CAN only be transferred as
      explicitly specified by the rules.  The creation, destruction, and
      transfer of talismans is secured.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a player CAN, by
      announcement, transfer the talisman for em to emself. The master
      of a player is the entity that possesses the talisman for em. A
      player who is eir own master is active; any other player is a
      zombie (syn. inactive).
      
      The master of a zombie CAN act on behalf of em, except a master
      CANNOT act on behalf of a zombie to:
        - initiate, support, object to, or perform a dependent action;
        - act on behalf of that zombie's zombies;
        - bid in a zombie auction;
        - enter a contract, pledge, or other type of agreement;
        - initiate a Call for Judgement;
        - create blots;
        - deregister.
      
      If a master causes a zombie to perform an ILLEGAL action, the
      master commits the Class 4+N Crime of Masterminding (where N is the
      class of the illegal action).
      
      If an active player who was a zombie has not received a Welcome
      Package since e most recently ceased being a zombie, and if eir
      resale value was less than 2 at any point during eir most recent
      time as a zombie, then any player CAN cause em to receive a
      Welcome Package by announcement.

Zombie Life Cycle

      Any player CAN, with notice, transfer the talisman for an active
      player who has not made a public announcement in the past 60 days
      to Agora.
      
      Resale value is a secured natural switch for zombies, tracked by
      the Registrar, with a default value of 2. Whenever the talisman
      for a zombie is transferred to a player, that zombie's resale value
      is decreased by 1. At the end of a zombie auction, the resale
      value of every zombie that is an excess lot in that auction
      decreases by 1.
      
      The talisman for a zombie with zero resale value CANNOT be
      transferred to any player other than that zombie.
      
      Any player CAN, with notice:
        - If a zombie has been a zombie for the past 90 days and not had
          Agora for a master during any of that time, transfer the
          talisman for em to Agora;
        - If a player possesses more than one talisman for persons other
          than emself, specify and transfer one of those talismans to
          Agora;
        - Deregister a zombie whose resale value is zero and whose
          master is Agora.
      
      The Registrar SHALL track the date for each zombie on which Agora
      was most recently eir master. The Registrar SHALL perform all
      POSSIBLE actions in the preceding paragraph in a timely fashion
      after first reporting their possibility via the facts in eir

Such is Karma

      Karma is a person switch tracked by the Herald in eir Weekly
      Report. Karma is an Integer switch. Agora also has an instance of
      the Karma switch.
      
      A player CAN publish a Notice of Honour. For a Notice of Honour
      to be valid, it must:
      
      1. Be clear that it is a Notice of Honour, and be the first valid
         Notice of Honour that player has published in the current week;
      
      2. Specify any other player or Agora to gain karma, and provide a
         reason for specifying that player; and
      
      3. Specify any player or Agora to lose karma, and provide a reason
         for specifying that player.
      
      When a valid Notice of Honour is published, the entity specified
      to gain karma has eir karma increased by one, and the entity
      specified to lose karma has eir karma decreased by one. Raising
      one entity's karma while lowering another's in this manner is
      considered to be a "transfer" of karma.
      
      A player's positions in Court are defined as follows:
      
      - Any player with a karma of 5 or greater is a Samurai.
      
      - Any player with a karma of -5 or less is an Gamma.

Win by Paradox

      If a CFJ about the effectiveness, possiblity, or legality of a
      change in the gamestate has been assigned a judgment of
      PARADOXICAL continuously for at least 7 days, and e has not done
      so already in respect of that CFJ, then that case's initiator,
      CAN, by announcement, Transcend Logic. When a person transcends
      logic, e wins the game.
      
      A player who wins in this fashion SHOULD submit a proposal to
      prevent the paradox from arising again.

Awards
   Even if it's not a win, there are still a good few opportunities to
   win bragging points, like Ribbons and Patent Titles.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2438/22 (Power=3)
Ribbons

      The Tailor is an office, and the recordkeepor of Ribbons.
      
      For each type of Ribbon, <type> Ribbon Ownership is a secured
      negative boolean person switch, tracked by the Tailor in eir
      monthly report.
      
      To "award a person a <Ribbon type>" is to flip that person's
      <that type> Ribbon Ownership to True. A person "owns a <Ribbon
      type>" if eir <that type> Ribbon Ownership is True.
      
      A person qualifies for a type of Ribbon if e has earned that type
      of Ribbon within the preceding 7 days (including earlier in the
      same message).
      
      While a person owns all types of Ribbon, that person can Raise a
      Banner by announcement. This causes that person to win the game.
      When a person wins this way, for each type of Ribbon, that
      person's <type> Ribbon Ownership is flipped to False.
      
      The types of Ribbon, and the methods of obtaining them, are as
      follows:
      
      Red (R): When a proposal is adopted and changes at least one rule
      that, immediately before or after the change, has Power >= 3, its
      proposer earns a Red Ribbon.
      
      Orange (O): When a proposal is adopted via a referendum on which
      no valid ballots were AGAINST (after evaluating conditionals), its
      proposer earns an Orange Ribbon.
      
      Green (G): While a person holds an elected office, has done so
      continuously for the past 30 days, and has not failed to perform
      any duties of that office within the appropriate time limits
      during those 30 days, that person qualifies for a Green Ribbon.
      
      Emerald (E): When a person wins an election, e earns an Emerald
      Ribbon.
      
      Cyan (C): When a person deputises for an office, that person earns
      a Cyan Ribbon.
      
      Blue (B): When a person assigns a judgement to a CFJ, and has
      never violated a time limit to assign a judgement to that CFJ,
      nor ever self-filed a motion to reconsider that CFJ, that person
      earns a Blue Ribbon.
      
      Magenta (M): When, during Agora's Birthday, a person publicly
      acknowledges it, that person earns a Magenta Ribbon.
      
      Ultraviolet (U): When a person is awarded the Patent Title
      Champion, that person earns an Ultraviolet Ribbon, unless the
      Champion title was awarded as the result of winning the game via
      this rule.
      
      Violet (V): When a person is awarded a Patent Title other than
      Champion or a degree, that person earns a Violet Ribbon.
      
      Indigo (I): When a person is awarded a degree, that person earns
      an Indigo Ribbon.
      
      Platinum (P): The Speaker qualifies for a Platinum Ribbon.
      
      Lime (L): A person qualifies for a Lime Ribbon if three or more
      proposals adopted in the preceding 7 days had that person as a
      coauthor.
      
      White (W): A player qualifies for a White Ribbon if e has never
      previously owned a White Ribbon (including under previous
      rulesets). A player who has been registered for at least 30 days
      and has never acted on eir own behalf to cause another person to
      gain a White Ribbon (including under a previous ruleset) CAN act
      on eir own behalf to award a White Ribbon to another person by
      announcement.
      
      Black (K): A statute CAN, as part of its effect, cause a person to
      earn a Black Ribbon. When this occurs, this Rule awards that
      person a Black Ribbon.
      
      Gray (A): The Tailor CAN award a Gray Ribbon by announcement,
      unless e has done so earlier in the month. E is ENCOURAGED to
      award such a Ribbon in the same message in which e publishes eir
      monthly report.
      
      Transparent (T): A person qualifies for a Transparent Ribbon while
      the number of other types of Ribbon that that person qualifies
      for, earns, and/or was awarded within the previous 7 days is at
      least 5.
      
      While a person qualifies for a type of Ribbon:
      
        - If e has not owned that type of Ribbon within the preceding 7
          days, any player CAN, by announcement, award em that type of
          Ribbon.
      
        - Otherwise, if e has not been awarded that type of Ribbon or
          the corresponding type of Glitter since e last earned or came
          to qualify for that type of Ribbon, and has not been so
          awarded five or more times within the past 24 hours, e CAN, by
          announcement, award emself that type of Glitter.

      Each time a player is awarded a type of Glitter, the Tailor CAN
      once by announcement, and SHALL in an officially timely fashion,
      grant the player N+1 coins, where N is the number of players who
      did not own the corresponding type of Ribbon at the time of the

Rule 2480/4 (Power=2.1)
Festivals

      Festivity is a secured singleton switch, whose possible values are
      integers ranging from 0 inclusive to the number of defined types
      of Ribbon exclusive, and defaulting to 0. While Agora's Festivity
      is 0, Festivity is tracked in the Tailor's monthly report.
      Otherwise, it is tracked in the Tailor's weekly report.
      
      If Agora's Festivity has had the same nonzero value for 14 days or
      more, or if it has a nonzero value and fewer than 5 players are
      Festive, then any player CAN flip it to 0 by announcement.
      
      A player who owns at least N types of Ribbon CAN Start a Rank N
      Festival, where N is an integer greater than Agora's Festivity,
      with 4 support from players who own at least N types of Ribbon.
      Upon doing so, Agora's Festivity is flipped to N. Exception: A
      player CANNOT do so if Agora's Festivity has had a value greater
      than or equal to N within the past 21 days.
      
      A person who owns a number of types of Ribbon equal to or greater
      than Agora's Festivity is known as Festive. Other persons are not
      Festive.

CFJ 1592 (called 01 Dec 2006): A patent title, once borne, is borne
   until explicitly revoked, even if the rule defining the patent title
   is repealed or the patent title was never defined by a rule.
CFJ 1731 (called 23 Aug 2007): It is possible for an entity {a person at

   title simultaneously.
CFJ 1591 (called 01 Dec 2006): Where a person bears the patent title X,

Degrees

      Certain patent titles are known as degrees. The degrees are
      
      - Associate of Nomic Artistry        (A.N.A.)
      - Associate of Nomic                 (A.N.)
      - Juris Doctorate of Nomic           (J.N.)
      - Baccalaureate of Nomic Artistry    (B.N.A.)
      - Baccalaureate of Nomic             (B.N.)
      - Magisteriate of Nomic Artistry     (M.N.A.)
      - Magisteriate of Nomic              (M.N.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic Artistry        (D.N.Art.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic History         (D.N.Hist.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic Law             (D.N.Law.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic Science         (D.N.Sci.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic Philosophy      (D.N.Phil.)
      
      There are four classes of degrees, ranked in ascending order of
      merit: Associate degrees (A.N.A. and A.N.), Baccalaureate degrees
      (J.N through B.N.), Magisteriate degrees (M.N.A and M.N), and
      Doctorate degrees (D.N.Art. through D.N.Phil.).
      
      A specified degree CAN be awarded by any player other than the
      awardee, with 2 Agoran consent. It SHOULD only be awarded for the
      publication of an original thesis of scholarly worth (including
      responses to peer-review), published with explicit intent to
      qualify for a degree. The Herald SHOULD coordinate the peer-review
      process and the awarding of degrees.
      
      Degrees SHOULD be awarded according to the extent to which the
      thesis contributes to Nomic culture or thought: Associate degrees
      for an appreciable contribution, Baccalaureate degrees for a
      substantial contribution, Magisteriate degrees for a remarkable
      contribution, and Doctorate degrees for an exceptional
      contribution. Any degree at the Doctorate level SHOULD take into
      account the awardee's academic history and participation in Agora
      over time.
      
      Theses for Artistry degrees SHOULD demonstrate substantial
      creativity and need not be in written form. Theses for all other
      degrees SHOULD demonstrate substantial research or analysis. J.N.
      and D.N.Law are appropriate for high-quality legal analysis, of
      the sort typical to CFJs, but exceeding an ordinary CFJ in depth.
      The D.N.Hist. degree is appropriate for historical research,
      especially when it presents a narrative that educates Agorans
      about the events of the past. The D.N.Sci. degree is appropriate
      for theses that demonstrate concrete or scientific thinking,
      whereas the D.N.Phil. is appropriate for theses that demonstrate
      abstract or philosophical thinking.

Leaders
   Agora has a good few leaders, most of which are nothing more than
   sinecures. This section isn't all that important.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 103/28 (Power=2)
The Speaker

      The Speaker is an imposed office and the figurehead leader of
      Agora. The player or players who have most recently won the game
      are called Laureled. If at any time the office of Speaker is
      vacant, or when one or more players win Agora, then the Prime
      Minister CAN once appoint a Laureled player to the office of
      Speaker by announcement.
      
      Whenever the Prime Minister CAN appoint a Laureled
      player to the office of Speaker, e SHALL do so in a timely manner,
      except that the Prime Minister MAY defer appointing a new Speaker
      while there is pending one or more open CFJs that could plausibly
      determine or affect the question of whether a player is Laureled.
      If the Prime Minister is emself Laureled, eir power to appoint a
      Speaker continues for the entirety of a message in which e resigns
      as Prime Minister, and if e is the only Laureled player, e CAN
      void that power, and thereby discharge the obligation to use it,
      by announcing that e declines to take the office.
      
      If the office of Speaker has been held continuously by the same
      person for 90+ days, then any player CAN appoint another player to
      the office with support.
      
      The Speaker has voting strength one greater than e would have if e
      did not hold the office.

Rule 1727/21 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;
      
      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial Rulesets
      of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets of Nomic
      World and other nomics,
      
      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June 30,
      1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by FIRST SPEAKER
      Michael Norrish, which read, in part,
      
        "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
        precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think we may
        as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules are invited.
        In accordance with the rules, these will be published, numbered
        and distributed by me at my earliest convenience."
      
      And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic,
      known unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was played
      on, until its Players, much later, gave it its OFFICIAL NAME of
      Agora,
      
      And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest, and
      most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the hard work
      and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent advice of
      Agoraphobes,
      
      And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
      founding,
      
      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year.

Tournaments

      A Tournament is a sub-game of Agora specifically sanctioned to be

      tournament is its Gamemaster. If a winner of a tournament is

      or persons win the game, otherwise the tournament concludes with
      no winner.
      
      A Tournament is governed by set of regulations, created in
      accordance with its parent rule, which have binding control over
      those who freely consent to play the tournament and over the
      tournament itself. Once the tournament is concluded, these
      regulations cease to have any effect, and CAN be repealed by any
      player by announcement. A Tournament's regulations collectively
      have Mint Authority.

Rule 2566/1 (Power=1)
Free Tournaments

      A player who is not the gamemaster of an existing tournament CAN
      initiate a sanctioned tournament with a specified set of
      regulations with 2 Agoran consent. A tournament created using this
      method is called a Free Tournament. Rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, only players CAN win the game via a free
      tournament.
      
      A free tournament CAN be concluded with no winner without 3
      objections. Tournaments SHOULD only be concluded in this manner if
      it is clear that its regulations are malformed or contrary to the
      tournament's intent or that it is IMPOSSIBLE for any player to win
      the tournament.

Barrels
   A minigame in which people try to collect barrles by fulfilling
   bargains.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2627/0 (Power=1.0)
The General Store

      Barrels are a currency tracked by the Coopor (an office) in eir
      monthly report. A player CAN Corner the Market by paying a fee of
      100 barrels.  When a player corners the market, e wins the game.
      
      A bargain is a specification consisting of a title, a payout (a
      number of barrels between 1 and 10), and a tender (a list of 6 or
      more rules-defined card types; a type may be repeated, with each
      repeat being a separate element on the list).
      
      A player CAN cash out a specified bargain that's "on the barrel",
      by announcement, provided that, in the same message, e paid cards
      (possibly spread over multiple sets) to successfully earn rules-
      defined products, and those cards match all of the cards types in
      that bargain's tender.  The payment of a particular card instance
      can only match a single tender element for the single cashing out
      of a bargain.
      
      When a player cashes out a bargain on the barrel, e earns the
      payout for that bargain.
      
      The Coopor CANNOT cash out a specific bargain in the 14 days after
      putting that bargain on the barrel.

Rule 2628/0 (Power=1.0)
Bargains on the Barrel

      If there are fewer than four bargains on the barrel, the Coopor
      CAN put a bargain on the barrel with notice.  If there are fewer
      than eight bargains on the barrel, the Coopor CAN put a bargain on
      the barrel with 3 support.
      
      The Coopor CAN take a bargain off the barrel without N objections,
      where N is the number of months, rounded up, since that bargain
      was last placed on the barrel.  Within 14 days after winning an
      election for Coopor, the Coopor CAN take any bargain off the
      barrel with notice.
      
      The Coopor's monthly report includes a list of all bargains on the
      barrel.  E SHOULD publish such a list whenever e adds or removes a
      bargain from the barrel.
