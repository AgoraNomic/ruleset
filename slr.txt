Rule 101/17 (Power=4)
The Game of Agora

      Agora is a game of Nomic, wherein Persons, acting in accordance
      with the Rules, communicate their game Actions and/or results of
      these actions via Fora in order to play the game. The game may be
      won, but the game never ends.
      
      Please treat Agora Right Good Forever.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1698/5 (Power=4)
Agora Is A Nomic

      Agora is ossified if it is IMPOSSIBLE for any reasonable
      combination of actions by players to cause arbitrary rule changes
      to be made and/or arbitrary proposals to be adopted within a
      four-week period.
      
      If, but for this rule, the net effect of a proposal would cause
      Agora to become ossified, or would cause Agora to cease to exist,
      it cannot take effect, rules to the contrary notwithstanding. If
      any other single change or inseperable group of changes to the
      gamestate would cause Agora to become ossified, or would cause
      Agora to cease to exist, it is cancelled and does not occur, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.

Rule 869/44 (Power=3)
How to Join and Leave Agora

      Any organism that is generally capable of freely originating and
      communicating independent thoughts and ideas is a person. Rules to
      the contrary notwithstanding, no other entities are persons.
      
      Citizenship is a person switch with values Unregistered (default)
      and Registered, tracked by the Registrar. Changes to citizenship
      are secured. A registered person is a Player. To "register"
      someone is to flip that person's Citizenship switch from
      Unregistered to Registered.
      
      An Unregistered person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or
      prevented by the rules) register by publishing a message that
      indicates reasonably clearly and reasonably unambiguously that e
      intends to become a player at that time. A player CAN deregister
      (cease being a player) by announcement. If e does so, e CANNOT
      register or be registered for 30 days.
      
      A person, by registering, agrees to abide by the Rules. The Rules
      CANNOT otherwise bind a person to abide by any agreement without
      that person's willful consent.
      
      If a player has not sent a message to a public forum in the last
      month, then any player CAN deregister em with 3 Agoran Consent.
      
      The Rules CANNOT compel non-players to act without their express
      or reasonably implied consent. The rules CANNOT compel players to
      unduly harass non-players. A non-person CANNOT be a player, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 478/34 (Power=3)
Fora

      Freedom of speech being essential for the healthy functioning of
      any non-Imperial nomic, it is hereby resolved that no Player shall
      be prohibited from participating in the Fora, nor shall any person
      create physical or technological obstacles that unduly favor some
      players' fora access over others.
      
      Publicity is a forum switch with values Public, Discussion, and
      Foreign (default), tracked by the Registrar. Changes to publicity
      are secured.
      
      The Registrar may change the publicity of a forum without
      objection as long as:
      
      1. e sends eir announcement of intent to that forum; and
      
      2. if the forum is to be made public, the announcement by which
         the Registrar makes that forum public is sent to all existing
         public fora.
      
      Each player should ensure e can receive messages via each public
      forum.
      
      A public message is a message sent via a public forum, or sent to
      all players and containing a clear designation of intent to be
      public. A rule can also designate that a part of one public
      message is considered a public message in its own right. A person
      "publishes" or "announces" something by sending a public message.
      
      Where the rules define an action that CAN be performed "by
      announcement", a person performs that action by unambiguously and
      clearly specifying the action and announcing that e performs it.
      Any action performed by sending a message is performed at the time
      date-stamped on that message. Actions in messages (including
      sub-messages) are performed in the order they appear in the
      message, unless otherwise specified.

Rule 2139/12 (Power=2)
The Registrar

      The Registrar is an office; its holder is responsible for keeping
      track of players.
      
      The Registrar's weekly report includes:
      
      1. A list of all players, including information sufficient to
         identify and contact each player.
      
      2. The date on which each player most recently became a player.
      
      3. For each forum with non-Foreign publicity, sufficient
         instructions for players to receive messages there.
      
      The Registrar's monthly report includes:
      
      1. For each former player for which the information is reasonably
         available, the dates on which e registered and deregistered.
      
      In the first Eastman week of every month the Registrar SHALL
      attempt to deregister every player that has not sent a message to
      a public forum in the preceding month.
      
      The Registrar's duties and abilities also include:
      
      * Changing the publicity of a forum, as described in Rule 478.
      
      * Publishing Cantus Cygnei and Writs of FAGE as described in
        Rule 1789.
      
      The Registrar is also responsible for tracking any switches,
      defined in a rule, that would otherwise lack an officer to track
      them, unless the switch is defined as untracked.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1789/9 (Power=3)
Cantus Cygneus

      Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously by
      the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part of
      it, e may submit a document to the Registrar, clearly labeled a
      Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and expressing eir
      reproach for those who e feels have treated em so badly.
      
      In a timely fashion after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the
      Registrar shall publish this document along with a Writ of
      Fugiendae Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione, commanding the Player
      to be deregistered. The Registrar shall note the method of
      deregistration for that Player in subsequent Registrar Reports.
      
      The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and the
      notation in the Registrar's Report will ensure that, henceforth,
      all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of FAGE.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2532/0 (Power=2)
Zombies

      Master is a secured player switch with possible values of any
      player, and Agora. Every player's default master is emself; rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding, a player CAN always flip eir own
      master to emself by announcement.
      
      A player whose master is not emself is a Zombie. A zombie's
      master, if another player, is allowed to act on behalf of the
      zombie (i.e. as the zombie's agent) to perform LEGAL actions.
      
      If a player has not made a public announcement in the past 60
      days, then any player CAN flip that player's master to Agora by
      announcement.
      
      Each zombie whose master is another player has an untracked switch
      indicating whether the zombie Owes a Scare to Agora, with values
      FALSE (default) and TRUE. All such switches are flipped to TRUE at
      the beginning of each month. A zombie's master CAN flip that
      zombie's switch to FALSE by causing the zombie to perform a scary
      public action for the announced purpose of satisfying this scare
      debt. If that switch for a given zombie is TRUE at the end of a
      month, then within the next seven days any player can flip that
      zombie's master to Agora by announcement.
      
      This switch is of course the zombie's Boo Lien switch.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1885/5 (Power=2)
Zombie Auctions

      Whenever a zombie (1) has Agora for a master, (2) an auction for
      it is not underway, and (3) has not been won as an auction lot in
      the past 14 days, then the Registrar CAN put that zombie (along
      with any other zombies that fulfill the same conditions) up for
      auction.
      
      In a timely fashion after the beginning of each month, the
      Registrar SHALL either initiate such an auction or, if no zombies
      meeting these conditions existed at the beginning of the month,
      announce that no such auction is necessary.
      
      For such an auction, the lots are the qualifying zombies, ordered
      at the discretion of the Registrar. The Registrar is the
      announcer, and the minimum bid is 1.
      
      The Registrar CAN, by announcement, flip the master switch of a
      zombie lot from Agora to that lot's winner after the winner has
      paid for the lot; for the purposes of the auction, to transfer a
      zombie to a player is to set that zombie's master switch to that
      player.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2514/2 (Power=1)
Emotions

      Emotion is a player switch, tracked by the Registrar, with
      possible values Joyous, Melancholy, and Indifferent, that defaults
      to Indifferent.
      
      At any time, any player CAN by announcement flip eir own Emotion
      to any value it is currently not. When doing this, e MUST provide
      a reason as to why e changed eir Emotion as such. It is IMPOSSIBLE
      to change another player's Emotion. A player's Emotion has the
      following effects:
      
      Indifferent: No effect. Melancholy: Any player that is not
      currently Melancholy MAY pat any Melancholy player on the back.
      Upon doing this, the Melancholy player is ENCOURAGED to change eir
      emotion to Joyous. Joyous: Any player that is Joyous is ENCOURAGED
      to pat Melancholy players on the back. E is also ENCOURAGED to do
      other kind acts, such as paying coins to other players or
      pending other players' proposals.

Rules & Regulations
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2141/10 (Power=3)
Role and Attributes of Rules

      A rule is a type of instrument with the capacity to govern the
      game generally, and is always taking effect. A rule's content
      takes the form of a text, and is unlimited in scope.
      
      Every rule has power between 0.1 and 4.0 inclusive. It is not
      possible for a rule to have a power outside this range.
      
      Rules have ID numbers, to be assigned by the Rulekeepor.
      
      Every rule shall have a title to aid in identification. If a rule
      ever does not have a title, the the Rulekeepor CAN and SHALL
      assign a title to it by announcement in a timely fashion.
      
      For the purposes of rules governing modification of instruments,
      the text, power, ID number, and title of a rule are all
      substantive aspects of the rule. However, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the Rulekeepor CAN set rule aspects as described
      elsewhere in this rule.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1688/9 (Power=3)
Power

      The Power of an entity is a non-negative rational number. An
      Instrument is an entity with positive Power.
      
      The Power of an entity cannot be set or modified except as
      stipulated by the Rules. All entities have Power zero except where
      specifically allowed by the rules.
      
      A Rule that makes a change, action, or value secured (hereafter
      the securing Rule) thereby makes it IMPOSSIBLE to perform that
      change or action, or to set or modify that value, except as
      allowed by an Instrument with Power greater than or equal to the
      change's Power Threshold.  This Threshold defaults to the securing
      Rule's Power, but CAN be lowered as allowed by that Rule
      (including by the Rule itself).
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2140/2 (Power=3)
Power Controls Mutability

      No entity with power below the power of this rule can
      
      1. cause an entity to have power greater than its own.
      
      2. adjust the power of an instrument with power greater than its
         own.
      
      3. set or modify any other substantive aspect of an instrument
         with power greater than its own. A "substantive" aspect of an
         instrument is any aspect that affects the instrument's
         operation.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 217/11 (Power=3)
Interpreting the Rules

      When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
      takes precedence. Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
      unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense, past
      judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the game.
      
      Definitions and prescriptions in the rules are only to be applied
      using direct, forward reasoning; in particular, an absurdity that
      can be concluded from the assumption that a statement about
      rule-defined concepts is false does not constitute proof that it
      is true. Definitions in lower-powered Rules do not overrule
      common-sense interpretations or common definitions of terms in
      higher-powered rules, but may constructively make reasonable
      clarifications to those definitions. For this purpose, a
      clarification is reasonable if and only if it adds detail without
      changing the underlying general meaning of the term and without
      causing the higher powered rule to be read in a way inconsistent
      with its text.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any rule change that would
      (1) prevent a person from initiating a formal process to resolve
      matters of controversy, in the reasonable expectation that the
      controversy will thereby be resolved; or (2) prevent a person from
      causing formal reconsideration of any judicial determination that
      e should be punished, is wholly void and without effect.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1030/13 (Power=3.2)
Precedence between Rules

      In a conflict between Rules, the conflict shall be resolved by
      performing the following comparisons in the sequence written in
      this rule, until the conflict is resolved.
      
      - In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
        the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
        Power; otherwise,
      
      - If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
        precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
        determining precedence relations, then the determinations of the
        precedence-determining Rule shall be used to resolve the
        conflicts; otherwise,
      
      - If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
        itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or takes
        precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
        provisions shall be used to resolve the conflict, unless they
        lead to contradictions between each other; otherwise,
      
      - If any of the rules in conflict have ID numbers, then the Rule
        with the lowest ID number takes precedence; otherwise,
      
      - The Rule enacted earliest takes precedence.
      
      Clauses in any other rule that broadly claim precedence (e.g. over
      "all rules" of a certain class) shall be, prima facie, considered
      to be limited claims of precedence or deference that are
      applicable only when such claims are evaluated as described within
      the above sequence.
      
      No change to the Ruleset can occur that would cause a Rule to
      directly claim precedence over this Rule as a means of determining
      precedence. This applies to changes by the enactment or amendment
      of a Rule, or of any other form. This Rule takes precedence over
      any Rule that would permit such a change to the Ruleset.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2240/1 (Power=3)
No Cretans Need Apply

      In a conflict between clauses of the same Rule, if exactly one
      claims precedence over the other, then it takes precedence;
      otherwise, the later clause takes precedence.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 105/19 (Power=3)
Rule Changes

      Where permitted by other rules, an instrument generally can, as
      part of its effect,
      
      1. enact a rule. The new rule has power equal to the minimum of
         the power specified by the enacting instrument, defaulting to
         one if the enacting instrument does not specify or if it
         specifies a power less than 0.1, and the maximum power
         permitted by other rules. The enacting instrument may specify a
         title for the new rule, which if present shall prevail. The ID
         number of the new rule cannot be specified by the enacting
         instrument; any attempt to so specify is null and void.
      
      2. repeal a rule. When a rule is repealed, it ceases to be a rule,
         its power is set to 0, and the Rulekeepor need no longer
         maintain a record of it.
      
      3. reenact a rule. A repealed rule identified by its most recent
         rule number MUST be reenacted with the same ID number and the
         next change identifier. If no text is specified, the rule is
         reenacted with the same text it had when it was most recently
         repealed. If the reenacting proposal provides new text for the
         rule, the rule SHOULD have materially the same purpose as did
         the repealed version. Unless specified otherwise by the
         re-enacting instrument, a re-enacted rule has power equal to
         the power it had at the time of its repeal (or power 1, if
         power was not defined at the time of that rule's repeal). If
         the re-enacting instrument is incapable of setting the
         re-enacted rule's power to that value, then the re-enactment is
         null and void.
      
      4. amend the text of a rule.
      
      5. retitle a rule.
      
      6. change the power of a rule.
      
      A rule change is any effect that falls into the above classes.
      Rule changes always occur sequentially, never simultaneously.
      
      Any ambiguity in the specification of a rule change causes that
      change to be void and without effect. An inconsequential variation
      in the quotation of an existing rule does not constitute ambiguity
      for the purposes of this rule, but any other variation does.
      
      A rule change is wholly prevented from taking effect unless its
      full text was published, along with an unambiguous and clear
      specification of the method to be used for changing the rule, at
      least 4 days and no more than 60 days before it would otherwise
      take effect.
      
      This rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be
      created, modified, or destroyed, or by which an entity can become
      a rule or cease to be a rule.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2493/2 (Power=3.1)
Regulations

      A Regulation is an textual entity defined as such by this rule. A
      regulation allows an officer (known as the Promulgator) to
      exercise rule defined powers. A regulation is in effect
      continuously from the time of its creation to the time of either
      its revocation or the repeal of the rule that allowed for its
      creation. When recommending a regulation, its Promulgator must
      specify by number the rule(s) upon which it is based (the parent
      rules), the list of which becomes an integral part of the
      regulation. The list of rules can generally be modified by the
      Promulgator according to the procedure for text changes.
      
      A regulation must be authorized by at least one rule in order for
      it to exist. A regulation has effect on the game (only) insofar as
      the rule or rules that authorized it permit it to have effect. If
      reasonably possible, a regulation should be interpreted so as to
      defer to other rules. The procedure for resolving conflict between
      regulations is the same as it is for rules (for the purposes of
      resolving conflicts only, a regulation is treated as if it had the
      power of its least powerful parent rule).
      
      Regulations are generally issued according to the following
      procedures, and they can be repealed by the announcement of their
      Promulgator. Alternate procedures may be used if provided for by
      all of the regulations's parent rules. If one parent rule
      specifies procedures that are more stringent than those that the
      other(s) specifies, those apply. Creating, modifying, revoking, or
      allowing for a regulation is secured at power 1.
      
      A regulation (or set of regulations), authorized by another rule,
      CAN generally be enacted or modified by its promulgator without 2
      objections, or with Agoran consent. A notice pursuant to the
      previous sentence is known as a "recommendation", and the
      regulation(s) are said to be "recommended" to Agora.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2494/0 (Power=1)
The Regkeepor

      The Regkeepor is an office, responsible for the maintenance of the
      Regulations. The Regulations are contained in the Regkeepor's
      weekly report, know as the Agora Nomic Code of Regulations
      (ACORN). E MAY publish multiple versions or editions of the ACORN.
      
      The ACORN is divided into titles, assigned by the Regkeepor, which
      are each given an integer. Generally, each office with the power
      to create regulations SHOULD be assigned the next successive
      natural number. Title 0 of the ACORN is reserved for use by the
      Regkeepor, and nothing in that title need be a regulation.
      Non-regulations printed in the ACORN have no binding effect, and
      SHALL clearly be marked by the Regkeepor.
      
      Each regulation SHALL be assigned an ID number by the Regkeepor,
      consisting of a string of the characters [0-9] and separator
      characters. The Regkeepor SHOULD establish some way of keeping
      track of the version of a regulations. The Regkeepor MAY also, at
      eir discretion, create ways of marking special types of Regulation
      (even in violation of the previous restrictions of this
      paragraph), mark sections or titles as reserved for future use,
      and make such other discussions of arrangement, annotation, and
      marking as are necessary and proper in the execution of eir
      duties.
      
      The Regkeepor SHOULD remember that the purpose of the ACORN is to
      make the regulations easily readable, and e SHALL not act in a
      manner intended to deceive others in eir official capacity.

Rule 1051/16 (Power=1)
The Rulekeepor

      The Rulekeepor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      maintaining the text of the rules of Agora.
      
      The Rulekeepor's Weekly report includes the Short Logical Ruleset.
      The Rulekeepor's Monthly report includes the Full Logical Ruleset.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1681/21 (Power=1)
The Logical Rulesets

      The Short Logical Ruleset (SLR) is a format of the ruleset. In
      this format, each rule is assigned to a category, and the rules
      are grouped according to their category.
      
      Rules are assigned to, ordered within, or moved between
      categories, and categories are added, changed, or empty categories
      removed, as the Rulekeepor sees fit.
      
      The listing of each rule in the SLR must include the rule's ID
      number, revision number, power, title, and text.
      
      The Rulekeepor is strongly DISCOURAGED from including any
      additional information in the SLR, except that which increases the
      readability of the SLR.
      
      The Full Logical Ruleset (FLR) is a format of the ruleset. In this
      format, rules are assigned to the same category and presented in
      the same order as in the SLR. The FLR must contain all the
      information required to be in the SLR, and any historical
      annotations which the Rulekeepor is required to record.
      
      The Rulekeepor SHOULD also include any other information which e
      feels may be helpful in the use of the ruleset in the FLR.
      
      Whenever a rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeepor SHALL record
      a historical annotation to the rule indicating:
      
      1. The type of change.
      
      2. The date on which the change took effect.
      
      3. The mechanism that specified the change.
      
      4. If the rule was changed due to a proposal, then that proposal's
         ID number, author, and co-author(s) (if any).

Rule 2221/6 (Power=3)
Cleanliness

      Any player CAN clean a rule without objection by specifying one or
      more corrections to spelling, grammar, capitalization, formatting,
      and/or dialect, or to whether a synonym or abbreviation is used in
      place of a word or phrase, in the rule's text and/or title; the
      rule is amended by this rule as specified by that person.

Rule 2429/1 (Power=1)
Bleach

      Replacing a non-zero amount of whitespace with a different
      non-zero amount of whitespace is generally insignificant, except
      for paragraph breaks.

========================================================================
General Definitions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2152/7 (Power=3)
Mother, May I?

      The following terms are defined. These definitions are used when a
      rule includes a term in all caps, and provide guidance in
      determining the ordinary-language meaning of a term when a rule
      includes a term otherwise. Earlier definitions take precedence
      over later ones. If a rule specifies one or more persons in
      connection with a term, then the term applies only to the
      specified person(s).
      
      1. CANNOT, IMPOSSIBLE, INEFFECTIVE, INVALID: Attempts to perform
         the described action are unsuccessful.
      
      2. MUST NOT, MAY NOT, SHALL NOT, ILLEGAL, PROHIBITED: Performing
         the described action violates the rule in question.
      
      3. NEED NOT, OPTIONAL: Failing to perform the described action
         does not violate the rules.
      
      4. SHOULD NOT, DISCOURAGED, DEPRECATED: Before performing the
         described action, the full implications of performing it should
         be understood and carefully weighed.
      
      5. CAN: Attempts to perform the described action are successful.
      
      6. MAY: Performing the described action does not violate the
         rules.
      
      7. MUST, SHALL, REQUIRED, MANDATORY: Failing to perform the
         described action violates the rule in question.
      
      8. SHOULD, ENCOURAGED, RECOMMENDED: Before failing to perform the
         described action, the full implications of failing to perform
         it should (in the ordinary-language sense) be understood and
         carefully weighed.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2162/10 (Power=2)
Switches

      A type of switch is a property that the rules define as a switch,
      and specify the following:
      
      1. The type(s) of entity possessing an instance of that switch. No
         other entity possesses an instance of that switch.
      
      2. One or more possible values for instances of that switch,
         exactly one of which is designated as the default. No other
         values are possible for instances of that switch.
      
      3. Optionally, exactly one office whose holder tracks instances of
         that switch. That officer's (weekly, if not specified
         otherwise) report includes the value of each instance of that
         switch whose value is not its default value; a public document
         purporting to be this portion of that officer's report is
         self-ratifying, and implies that other instances are at their
         default value.
      
      At any given time, each instance of a switch has exactly one
      possible value for that type of switch. If an instance of a switch
      comes to have a value, it ceases to have any other value. If an
      instance of a switch would otherwise fail to have a possible
      value, it comes to have its default value.
      
      "To flip an instance of a switch" is to make it come to have a
      given value. "To become X" (where X is a possible value of
      exactly one of the subject's switches) is to flip that switch to
      X.
      
      If an action or set of actions would cause the value of an
      instance of a switch to become indeterminate, the instance instead
      takes on its last determinate and possible value, if any,
      otherwise it takes on its default value.
      
      A singleton switch is a switch for which Agora Nomic is the only
      entity possessing an instance of that switch.
      
      A boolean switch is a switch with values True and False. A
      positive boolean switch has a default of True; a negative boolean
      switch has a default of False.
      
      Attempting to flip an instance of a switch to a value it already
      has does not flip the switch. However, if a person is REQUIRED to
      flip a switch instance to a value it already has, then either
      attempting to do so using the required mechanism, or announcing
      that the switch already has the required value, fulfills the
      requirement without flipping the switch.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2509/2 (Power=2)
Agoran Numbers

      A "number" is considered to refer to a real number, unless
      otherwise explicitly specified.  A "number of (items)", where
      (items) is a set of discrete entities, is considered to refer to a
      non-negative integer, unless otherwise explicitly specified.
      
      If a switch is defined as being associated with a specified set of
      numbers (a numerical switch), then the possible values for that
      switch are the numbers in that set. In particular, a natural or
      integer switch is a switch with possible values the non-negative
      integers or all integers, respectively. If a limit is further
      defined, the possible values are the numbers of the set within the
      specified limits.
      
      If 0 is in the specified values for a numerical switch and no
      default value is otherwise specified, 0 is the default value for
      that switch.
      
      If the rules describe mathematical operations to be used in
      flipping an instance of a numerical switch, the operations are
      interpreted as having common-sense mathematical application to
      determine that instance's resulting value. For example,
      "increasing a switch instance by M" is equivalent to "flipping a
      switch instance from its current value N to the value N+M". If the
      specified mathematical operation would result in a value outside
      that switch's defined set, the flipping CANNOT be performed, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2125/10 (Power=3)
Regulated Actions

      An action is restricted if: (1) the Rules limit, allow, enable, or
      permit its performance; (2) describe the circumstances under which
      the action would succeed or fail; or (3) the action would, as part
      of its effect, modify information for which some player is
      required to be a recordkeepor.
      
      A Restricted Action CAN only be performed as described by the
      Rules, and only using the methods explicitly specified in the
      Rules for performing the given action. The Rules SHALL NOT be
      interpreted so as to proscribe unrestricted actions.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1023/42 (Power=2)
Agoran Time

      The following terms are defined:
      
      1. The phrase "in a timely fashion" means "within 7 days". This
         time period is set when the requirement is created (i.e. X days
         before the limit ends). A requirement to perform an action at
         an exact instant (e.g. "when X, Y SHALL Z"), but not "in the
         same message", is instead interpreted as a requirement to
         perform that action in a timely fashion after that instant.
      
      2. Agoran epochs:
      
           1. Agoran days begin at midnight UTC.
      
           2. Agoran weeks begin at midnight UTC on Monday. Eastman
              weeks begin at midnight UTC on the 1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd,
              and 29th of each Gregorian month; the fifth one of the
              month (if any) lasts till the end of the month.
      
           3. Agoran months begin at midnight UTC on the first day of
              each Gregorian month.
      
           4. Agoran quarters begin when the Agoran months of January,
              April, July, and October begin.
      
           5. Agoran years begin when the Agoran month of January
              begins.
      
           6. A pivot is either the instant at which Agora Nomic began
              (June 30, 1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200) or an instant at which
              at least one person won the game. When used as a period of
              time, a "Round" (historical syn: "game") is the period of
              time between a pivot and the next pivot.
      
         The "Agoran" qualifier is assumed unless a different definition
         is indicated (e.g. Eastman weeks). These definitions do not
         apply to relative durations (e.g. "within <number> days after
         <event>").
      
      3. Two points in time are within a month of each other if:
      
          1. they occur in the same Agoran month;
      
          2. they occur in two consecutive Agoran months, and the later
             of the two occurs in an earlier day in the month than the
             earlier one;
      
          3. they occur in two consecutive Agoran months on the same day
             of the month, and the later of the two occurs at the same
             or earlier time of day.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1728/37 (Power=3)
Dependent Actions

      A rule which purports to allow a person (the performer) to perform
      an action by a set of one or more of the following methods (N is 1
      unless otherwise specified):
      
      1. Without N Objections, where N is a positive integer no greater
         than 8. ("Without Objection" is shorthand for this method with
         N = 1.)
      
      2. With N Support, where N is a positive integer. ("With
         Support" is shorthand for this method with N = 1.)
      
      3. With N Agoran Consent, where N is an integer multiple of 0.1
         with a minimum of 1.
      
      4. With Notice.
      
      5. With T Notice, where T is a time period.
      
      thereby allows em to perform the action by announcement if all of
      the following are true:
      
      1. A person (the initiator) announced intent to perform the
         action, unambiguously and clearly specifying the action and
         method(s) (including the value of N and/or T for each method),
         at most fourteen days earlier.
      
      2. If the action is to be performed Without N Objections, With N
         Agoran Consent, or With Notice, if the intent was announced at
         least 4 days earlier
      
      3. If the action is to be performed With T Notice, if the intent
         was announced at least T earlier.
      
      4. At least one of the following is true:
      
         1. The performer is the initiator.
      
         2. The initiator was authorized to perform the action due to
            holding a rule-defined position now held by the performer.
      
         3. The initiator is authorized to perform the action, the
            action depends on support, the performer has supported the
            intent, and the rule authorizing the performance does not
            explicitly prohibit supporters from performing it.
      
      5. Agora is Satisfied with the announced intent, as defined by
         other rules.
      
      6. If a set of conditions for the performance of the action was
         given in the announcement of intent to perform the action, all
         those conditions are met.
      
      The actor SHOULD publish a list of supporters if the action
      depends on support, and a list of objectors if it depends on
      objections.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2124/22 (Power=2)
Agoran Satisfaction

      A Supporter of a dependent action is an eligible entity who has
      publicly posted (and not withdrawn) support (syn. "consent") for
      an announcement of intent to perform the action. An Objector to a
      dependent action is an eligible entity who has publicly posted
      (and not withdrawn) an objection to the announcement of intent to
      perform the action.
      
      The entities eligible to support or object to a dependent action
      are, by default, all players, subject to modification by the
      document authorizing the dependent action. However, the previous
      sentence notwithstanding, the initiator of the intent is not
      eligible to support it.
      
      Agora is Satisfied with an intent to perform a specific action if
      and only if:
      
      1. if the action is to be performed Without N Objections, then it
         has fewer than N objectors;
      
      2. if the action is to be performed With N support, then it has
         N or more supporters; and
      
      3. if the action is to be performed with N Agoran Consent, then
         the ratio of supporters to objectors is greater than N, or the
         action has at least one supporter and no objectors.
      
      4. if the action is to be performed With Notice or With T Notice.
      
      The above notwithstanding, if the action depends on objections,
      and an objection to it has been withdrawn within the past 24
      hours, then Agora is not Satisfied with the intent.
      
      The above notwithstanding, Agora is not satisfied with the intent
      if the Speaker has objected to it in the last 48 hours.
      
      A person CANNOT support or object to an announcement of intent
      before the intent is announced, or after e has withdrawn the same
      type of response.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2466/1 (Power=3)
Acting on Behalf

      When a rule allows one person (the agent) to act on behalf of
      another (the principal) to perform an action, that agent CAN
      perform the action if it is POSSIBLE for the principal to do so,
      taking into account any prerequisites for the action. If the
      enabling rule does not specify the mechanism by which the agent
      may do so, then the agent CAN perform the action in the same
      manner in which the principal CAN do so, with the additional
      requirement that the agent must, in the message in which the
      action is performed, uniquely identify the principal and that the
      action is being taken on behalf of that person.
      
      A person SHALL NOT act on behalf of another person if doing so
      causes the second person to violate the rules. A person CANNOT act
      on behalf of another person to do anything except perform a game
      action; in particular, a person CANNOT act on behalf of another
      person to send a message, only to perform specific actions that
      might be taken within a message.
      
      When an action is performed on behalf of a principal, then the
      action is considered for all game purposes to have been performed
      by the principal, unless a rule specifically states that it is
      treated differently for some purpose, in which case it is treated
      as described by that rule.
      
      Allowing a person to act on behalf of another person is secured at
      power 2.0. This rule takes precedence over any rule that would
      prohibit a person from taking an action, except that it defers to
      any rule that imposes limitations specifically on actions taken on
      behalf of another person.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2524/0 (Power=2.4)
Acting on Behalf via Contracts

      If a rule says that a contract CAN do something by announcement,
      it is equivalent to saying that that any person CAN take that
      action by announcement if the contract's text says that e CAN do
      so under the circumstances; if whether the contract enables the
      person to do so is indeterminate, or is the subject of an
      inextricable conditional, the action is IMPOSSIBLE. A person SHALL
      NOT cause a contract to violate a rule using this method.
      
      If a rule specifies that a contract SHALL or SHALL NOT do
      something, each party to the contract SHALL ensure that the
      contract respectively does or does not do that thing.
      
      The text of a contract can permit persons to act on behalf of a
      party or group of parties. To do so, it must specify:
      
      a. Which of its parties can be acted on behalf of;
      
      b. What actions can be taken;
      
      c. Who can take the actions; and
      
      d. Any conditions or limitations upon the actions. If any such
         limitations or conditions are inextricable, the actions CANNOT
         be used.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2518/0 (Power=3)
Determinacy

      If a value CANNOT be reasonably determined (without circularity or
      paradox) from information reasonably available, or if it
      alternates indefinitely between values, then the value is
      considered to be indeterminate, otherwise it is determinate.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1586/8 (Power=2)
Definition and Continuity of Entities

      If multiple rules attempt to define an entity with the same name,
      then they refer to the same entity. A rule-defined entity's name
      CANNOT be changed to be the same as another rule-defined entity's
      name.
      
      A rule, contract, or regulation that refers to an entity by name
      refers to the entity that had that name when the rule first came
      to include that reference, even if the entity's name has since
      changed.
      
      If the entity that defines another entity is amended such that it
      no longer defines the second entity, then the second entity and
      its attributes cease to exist.
      
      If the entity that defines another entity is amended such that it
      defines the second entity both before and after the amendment, but
      with different attributes, then the second entity and its
      attributes continue to exist to whatever extent is possible under
      the new definitions.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2505/0 (Power=1)
Random Choices

      When a Rule specifies that a random choice be made, then the
      choice shall be made using whatever probability distribution among
      the possible outcomes the Rule specifies, defaulting to a uniform
      probability distribution.
      
      The choice CAN be made using any physical or computational process
      whose probability distribution among the possible outcomes is
      reasonably close to that required by the Rules, and for which the
      final choice is not trivially predictable by the selecting person
      in advance. The selecting person SHOULD make the selection method
      public, and SHOULD use a method for which the final probability
      distribution can be readily confirmed.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2517/0 (Power=3)
Conditionals and Extricability

      A conditional is any textual structure that attempts to make a
      statement (the substrate) affecting any part or aspect of the
      gamestate, or the permissibility, possibility, or effect of any
      action affecting such a part or aspect, dependent on the truth
      value or other state of a textual structure (the condition). The
      condition is said to be "affixed" to the substrate (inverse "to be
      conditional upon").
      
      A condition is inextricable if it is unclear, ambiguous, circular,
      inconsistent, paradoxical, depends on information that is
      indeterminate, or is impossible or unreasonably difficult to
      determine, or otherwise requires an unreasonable effort to
      resolve; otherwise it is extricable. A conditional is inextricable
      if its condition is inextricable; otherwise it is extricable. A
      player SHOULD NOT use an inextricable conditional for any purpose.
      
      An action is said to be "subject to" a conditional if its
      possibility, permissibility, or effect (depending on context) is
      determined by the conditional. A value is said to be subject to a
      conditional of the state of the value is determined by the
      conditional.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Proposals
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2350/9 (Power=3)
Proposals

      A proposal is a type of entity consisting of a body of text and
      other attributes. A player CAN create a proposal by announcement,
      specifying its text and optionally specifying any of the following
      attributes:
      
      * An associated title.
      
      * A list of co-authors (which must be persons other than the
        author).
      
      * An adoption index.
      
      Creating a proposal adds it to the Proposal Pool. Once a proposal
      is created, nether its text nor any of the aforementioned
      attributes can be changed. The author (syn. proposer) of a
      proposal is the person who submitted it.
      
      If a decision of whether to adopt a proposal was resolved as
      FAILED QUORUM in the last seven days, the Promotor CAN once add
      the proposal back to the Proposal Pool by announcement.
      
      The author of a proposal in the Proposal Pool CAN remove (syn.
      retract, withdraw) it from the Pool by announcement.
      
      The Promotor CAN remove a proposal from the Proposal Pool by
      announcement if it is not pending and has been added to the Pool
      more than 14 days ago.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2445/12 (Power=1)
How to Pend a Proposal

      Imminence is a switch, tracked by the Promotor, possessed by
      proposals in the Proposal Pool, whose value is either "pending" or
      "not pending" (default).
      
      Any player CAN flip a specified proposal's imminence to "pending"
      by announcement by destroying 1 paper.
      
      An Official Proposal is a proposal designated as such by the
      Rules; generally official proposals that are created as part of an
      Officer's duties. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, an
      Official proposal is always pending. Rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, players CANNOT claim rewards for the adoption of
      an Official proposal.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1607/43 (Power=3)
Distribution

      The Promotor is an office; its holder is responsible for receiving
      and distributing proposals.
      
      Determining whether to adopt a proposal is an Agoran decision. For
      this decision, the vote collector is the Assessor, the adoption
      index is initially the adoption index of the proposal, or 1.0 if
      the proposal does not have one, and the text, author, and
      coauthors of the proposal are essential parameters. Initiating
      such a decision is known as distribution, and removes the proposal
      from the Proposal Pool.
      
      The Promotor CAN distribute a proposal which is in the Proposal
      Pool at any time, by announcement. The Promotor SHALL NOT
      distribute proposals which are not pending.
      
      In a given Agoran week, the Promotor SHALL, as part of eir weekly
      duties, distribute all pending proposals except for those exempted
      from automatic distribution by other rules.
      
      Distributed proposals have ID numbers, to be assigned by the
      Promotor.
      
      If there is a Proposal in the Pool that it would otherwise be
      IMPOSSIBLE for any player to distribute, then any player CAN
      distribute that Proposal Without 3 Objections.
      
      The Promotor's report includes a list of all proposals in the
      Proposal Pool, along with their text and attributes. This portion
      of a public document purporting to be a Promotor's report is
      self-ratifying.

The Assessor

      The Assessor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      collecting votes and keeping track of related properties.

Rule 106/39 (Power=3)
Adopting Proposals

      When a decision about whether to adopt a proposal is resolved, if
      the outcome is ADOPTED, then the proposal in question is adopted,
      and unless other rules prevent it from taking effect, its power is
      set to the minimum of four and its adoption index, and then it
      takes effect. Except as prohibited by other rules, a proposal that
      takes effect CAN and does, as part of its effect, apply the
      changes that it specifies. If the proposal cannot make some such
      changes, this does not preclude the other changes from taking
      place.
      
      If there is no Agoran Decision to adopt a particular proposal that
      has an outcome of ADOPTED, that proposal CANNOT take effect, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.
      
      Preventing a proposal from taking effect is a secured change; this
      does not apply to generally preventing changes to specified areas
      of the gamestate, nor to a proposal preventing itself from taking
      effect (its no- effect clause is generally interpreted as applying
      only to the rest of the proposal). Except insofar as the actions
      performed by a proposal happen one after another, rather than
      simultaneously, a proposal's effect is instantaneous. A proposal
      can neither delay nor extend its own effect. Once a propsal
      finishes taking effect, its power is set to 0.

Silliness

      Each Agoran Week a Player is designated the Silly Person. The
      Silly Person SHALL and CAN in that week, by announcement (1)
      designate another player, who has not been the Silly Person in the
      past two weeks, to be the next week's Silly Person; (2) submit a
      Silly Proposal. If there is ever no Silly Person or the Silly
      Person is not a player, then the next week's Silly Person is the
      first player that any player publicly designates to be the next
      week's Silly Person.
      
      A Silly Proposal is a Proposal whose sole contents are one of the
      following:
      
      i) A limerick.
      
      ii) A poem with a rhyme scheme and/or strict metrical structure no
      longer than 14 lines (No free verse!)
      
      iii) A joke or truly hideous pun of no more than a two hundred
      words.
      
      The first Silly Proposal submitted by the week's Silly Person is
      an Official Proposal.

Rule 693/16 (Power=3)
Agoran Decisions

      When the rules calls for an Agoran decision to be made, the
      decision-making process takes place in the following three
      stages, each described elsewhere:
      
      1. Initiation of the decision.
      
      2. Voting of the people.
      
      3. Resolution of the decision.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 107/20 (Power=3)
Initiating Agoran Decisions

      An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
      initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
      to initiate the decision. This notice is invalid if it lacks any
      of the following information, and the lack is correctly identified
      within one week after the notice is published:
      
      1. The matter to be decided (for example, "the adoption of
         proposal 4781");
      
      2. The voting method;
      
      3. A clear description of the valid options;
      
      4. The identity of the vote collector; and
      
      5. Any additional information defined by the rules as essential
         parameters.
      
      The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting period
      for the decision. The voting period lasts for 7 days. The minimum
      voting period for a decision with at least two options is five
      days. The vote collector for a decision with less than two options
      CAN and SHALL end the voting period by announcement, if it has not
      ended already, and provided that e resolves the decision in the
      same message.
      
      The voting period for a decision cannot be set or changed to a
      duration longer than fourteen days.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2528/0 (Power=3)
Voting Methods

      Each Agoran decision has a voting method, which must be
      AI-majority, instant runoff, or first-past-the-post. The voting
      method is that specified by the authorizing authority, or
      first-past-the-post by default.
      
      Each Agoran decision has a set of valid options (the choices that
      the voters are being asked to select from) and valid votes (the
      ways in which the voters can express their opinion or lack
      thereof. For AI-majority decisions, the valid options are FOR and
      AGAINST; for other decisions, the valid options are defined by
      other rules.
      
      The valid votes on an Agoran decision are:
      
      1. PRESENT;
      
      2. The valid conditional votes, as defined by rules of power at
         least that of this rule; and
      
      3. For an instant runoff decision, the ordered lists of entities.
      
      4. For any other decision, the valid options.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 683/26 (Power=3)
Voting on Agoran Decisions

      An entity submits a ballot on an Agoran decision by publishing a
      notice satisfying the following conditions:
      
      1. The ballot is submitted during the voting period for the
         decision.
      
      2. The entity casting the ballot (the voter) was, at the
         initiation of the decision, a player.
      
      3. The ballot clearly identifies the matter to be decided.
      
      4. The ballot clearly identifies a valid vote, as determined by
         the voting method.
      
      5. The ballot clearly sets forth the voter's intent to place
         the identified vote.
      
      6. The voter has no other valid ballots on the same decision.
      
      A valid ballot is a ballot, correctly submitted, that has not
      been withdrawn. During the voting period of an Agoran decision,
      a player CAN by announcement withdraw (syn. retract) a ballot
      that e submitted on that decision. To "change" one's vote is to
      retract eir previous ballot (if any), then submit a new one.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 208/12 (Power=3)
Resolving Agoran Decisions

      The vote collector for an unresolved Agoran decision CAN resolve
      it by announcement, indicating the outcome. If it was required to
      be initiated, then e SHALL resolve it in a timely fashion after
      the end of the voting period. To be valid, this announcement must
      satisfy the following conditions:
      
      1. It is published after the voting period has ended.
      
      2. It clearly identifies the matter to be resolved.
      
      3. It specifies the outcome, as described elsewhere, and, if there
         was more than one valid option, provides a tally of the voters'
         valid ballots.
      
      Each Agoran decision has exactly one vote collector, defaulting to
      the initiator of the decision. If the vote collector is defined by
      reference to a position (or, in the default case, if the initiator
      was so defined), then the vote collector is the current holder of
      that position.
      
      This rule takes precedence over any rule that would provide
      another mechanism by which an Agoran decision may be resolved.
      
      In general, changes to the gamestate due to the outcome of an
      Agoran decision take effect when the decision is resolved.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 955/30 (Power=3)
Determining the Will of Agora

      Each Agoran decision has a voting method, which determines how
      voters may vote on it and how to calculate the outcome. The
      strength of a ballot is the voting strength of the voter who cast
      it on that Agoran decision.
      
      1. For an AI-majority decision, let F be the total strength of all
         valid ballots cast FOR a decision, A be the same for AGAINST,
         and AI be the adoption index of the decision. The outcome is
         ADOPTED if F/A >= AI and F/A > 1 (or F>0 and A=0), otherwise
         REJECTED.
      
      2. For an instant runoff decision, the outcome is whichever option
         wins according to the standard definition of instant runoff.
         For this purpose, a ballot of strength N is treated as if it
         were N distinct ballots expressing the same preferences. In
         case multiple valid options tie for the lowest number of votes
         at any stage, the vote collector CAN and must, in the
         announcement of the decision's resolution, select one such
         option to eliminate; if, for M > 1, all eir possible choices in
         the next M stages would result in the same set of options being
         eliminated, e need not specify the order of elimination. If an
         entity that is part of a valid vote is not a valid option at
         the end of the voting period, or disqualified by the rule
         providing for the decision, then that entity is eliminated
         prior to the first round of counting.
      
      3. For a first-past-the-post decision, the outcome is whichever
         option received the highest total strength of valid ballots. In
         case of a tie, the vote collector CAN and must, in the
         announcement of the decision's resolution, select one of the
         leaders as the outcome.
      
      The previous notwithstanding:
      
      - If there is more than one option, and the number of valid
        ballots is less than the quorum of that decision, the outcome is
        instead FAILED QUORUM.
      
      - If there are no valid options, the outcome is null.
      
      The outcome of a decision is determined when it is resolved, and
      cannot change thereafter.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 879/34 (Power=2)
Quorum

      Each Agoran Decision has a quorum. This is a number set when the
      decision is created, and thereafter cannot be changed. When a
      person initiates an Agoran Decision, that person SHALL state the
      quorum of that decision. However, incorrectly stating the quorum
      of a decision does not invalidate the initiation, nor does it
      actually change the quorum of the decision.
      
      The quorum that an Agoran Decision gains as it is created can be
      defined by other rules of power 2 or greater. If no other rule
      defines the quorum of an Agoran Decision, the quorum for that
      decision is equal to the number of players who voted on the Agoran
      Decision to adopt a proposal that had been most recently resolved
      at the time of that decision's initiation, minus 2.
      
      As an exception to the previous paragraph, the quorum of an
      Agoran Decision can never be less than 2. If the rules would
      attempt to set the quorum of an Agoran Decision to less than 2,
      it is set to 2 instead.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2422/2 (Power=3)
Voting Strength

      The voting strength of an entity on an Agoran decision is an
      integer between 0 and 5 inclusive, defined by rules of power 2
      or greater. If not otherwise specified, the voting strength of
      an entity on an Agoran decision is 1.
      
      When multiple rules set or modify an entity's voting strength on
      an Agoran decision, it shall be determined by first applying the
      rule(s) which set it to a specific value, using the ordinary
      precedence of rules, and then applying the rules, other than
      this one, which modify it, in numerical order by ID. Finally, if
      theresult of the calculation is not an integer, it is rounded
      up, and then if it is outside the allowable range of values for
      voting strength, it is set to the the minimum value if it was
      less and the maximum value if it was more.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2127/11 (Power=3)
Conditional Votes

      A conditional vote on an Agoran decision is a vote which indicates
      a vote based on some condition(s). A conditional vote is evaluated
      at the end of the voting period and, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, is clearly specified if and only if the value of
      the condition(s) is/are determinate at the end of the voting
      period. If the conditional is clearly specified, and evaluates to
      a valid vote, it is counted as that vote; otherwise, it is counted
      as PRESENT.
      
      Any vote which is clearly expressed as a conditional, e.g. "FOR if
      <X> is true, AGAINST otherwise", is a valid conditional vote that
      evaluates as specified.
      
      A vote endorsing another person is equivalent to a conditional
      vote evaluating to the vote specified in that person's valid
      ballot on the decision, if any.
      
      For an instant runoff decision, a vote consisting of a list, one
      or more entries of which are valid conditional votes, and the
      remaining entries of which are valid options, is a valid
      conditional vote. Such a vote is evaluated by evaluating each
      conditional entry to a list of votes (or an empty list, if it
      evaluates to PRESENT either directly or indirectly), and then
      concatenating those lists with the specified valid options in the
      order they occurred in the original vote.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2168/7 (Power=1)
Extending the voting period

      Whenever the voting period of an Agoran decision would end, and
      the result would be FAILED QUORUM, the length of the voting period
      for that decision is instead increased to 14 days, except if it is
      already that length, provided this has not already happened for
      the decision in question.
      
      Upon such an occurrence, the vote collector for the decision SHALL
      issue a humiliating public reminder naming the slackers who have
      not yet cast any votes on it despite being eligible, and CAN end
      its voting period by announcement (resolving it constitutes an
      implicit announcement that its voting period is first ended) if
      the result would no longer be FAILED QUORUM, or if the decision is
      whether to adopt a proposal and no voter (other than possibly the
      proposal's author) has voted FOR.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1950/33 (Power=3)
Decisions with Adoption Indices

      Adoption index is an untracked switch possessed by Agoran
      decisions and proposals, whose value is either "none" (default) or
      an integral multiple of 0.1 from 1.0 to 9.9.
      
      Adoption index is secured with a power threshold of 2.
      
      Adoption index is an essential parameter of an Agoran decision if
      that decision has an adoption index.
      
      For any Agoran decision with an adoption index, the voting method
      is AI-majority.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2034/9 (Power=3)
Vote Protection and Cutoff for Challenges

      A public message purporting to resolve an Agoran decision
      constitutes self-ratifying claims that
      
      1. such a decision existed,
      
      2. it was resolved as indicated, and
      
      3. (if the indicated outcome was to adopt a proposal) such a
         proposal existed, was adopted, and took effect.

Offices & Reporting
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1006/45 (Power=2)
Offices

      Officeholder is an office switch tracked by the ADoP, with
      possible values of any person or "vacant". An officer is the
      holder of an office, who may be referred to by the name of that
      office. If the holder of an office is ever not a player, it
      becomes vacant.
      
      An imposed office is an office described as such by the rule
      defining it. All others are elected. A person CANNOT be made the
      holder of an elected office without eir explicit or reasonably
      implied consent.
      
      A holder of an elected office who did not become its holder by
      winning an election, and has not won an election for that office
      since, is an interim holder. An elected office that is either
      vacant or has an interim holder is an interim office.
      
      The holder of an elected office CAN resign it by announcement,
      causing it to become vacant. The non-interim holder of an elected
      office CAN, With 3 Support, resign the office while appointing
      another player to become the holder of the office, provided that
      other player is one of the Supporters. Any player CAN cause an
      office to become vacant without 2 objections.
      
      When a proposal takes effect and creates a new office, if the
      proposal does not specify otherwise, the author of that proposal
      becomes the holder of the office.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2143/27 (Power=1)
Official Reports and Duties

      For each person:
      
      1. If any task is defined by the rules as part of that person's
         weekly duties, then e SHALL perform it at least once each week.
         If any information is defined by the rules as part of that
         person's weekly report, then e SHALL maintain all such
         information, and the publication of all such information is
         part of eir weekly duties.
      
      2. If any task is defined by the rules as part of that person's
         monthly duties, then e SHALL perform it at least once each
         month. If any information is defined by the rules as part of
         that person's monthly report, then e SHALL maintain all such
         information, and the publication of all such information is
         part of eir monthly duties.
      
      Any information defined by the rules as part of a person's report,
      without specifying which one, is part of eir weekly report.
      Failure of a person to perform any duty required of em within the
      allotted time is the Class-2 crime of Tardiness.
      
      An official duty for an office is any duty that the Rules
      specifically assign to that office's holder in particular
      (regardless of eir identity).
      
      A person SHALL NOT publish information that is inaccurate or
      misleading while performing an official duty, or within a document
      purporting to be part of any person or office's weekly or monthly
      report.
      
      Reports SHALL be published in plain text. Tabular data must line
      up properly when viewed in a monospaced font. Publishing a report
      that deviates from these restrictions is the Class 2 Crime of
      Making My Eyes Bleed.
      
      Officers SHOULD maintain a publicly visible copy of their reports
      on the World Wide Web, and they SHOULD publish the address of this
      copy along with their published reports.
      
      A convergence is any change to the gamestate that has, in
      accordance with the rules, been designated as such. A change to
      the gamestate SHOULD NOT be designated as a convergence unless it
      is designed to resolve gamestate ambiguity. Designating a change
      as a convergence is secured; any player CAN do so with 3 Agoran
      Consent. When officeholders provide historical information, they
      NEED NOT accurately document the changes made by the convergence
      or related ambiguities, provided that they instead note that the
      convergence occurred. Information about a convergence (but not the
      resulting state) is inherently uncertain and is thus excluded from
      self-ratification.

Deputisation

      A player (the deputy) CAN perform an action ordinarily reserved
      for an office-holder as if e held the office if
      
      1. the rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of
      holding that office, to perform the action (this requirement is
      fulfilled by the deputy performing the action);
      
      2. it would be POSSIBLE for the deputy to perform the action,
      other than by deputisation, if e held the office;
      
      3. either (i) a time limit by which the rules require the action
      to be performed has expired or (ii) the office is vacant.
      
      4. either (i) the office is vacant, (ii) the aforementioned time
      limit expired more than fourteen days ago, or (iii) the deputy
      announced between two and fourteen days earlier that e intended to
      deputise for that office for the purposes of the particular
      action.
      
      5. the deputy, when performing the action, announces that e is
      doing so by deputisation.
      
      When a player deputises for an elected office, e becomes the
      holder of that office, unless the action being performed would

      same message.
      
      b) By announcement, if e is the ADoP and if the office is interim,
      or if e is the holder of that office.
      
      The above notwithstanding, an election for an office CANNOT be
      initiated if one is already in progress.
      
      When an election is initiated, it enters the nomination period,
      which lasts for 4 days. After an election is initiated and until
      nominations close, any player CAN become a candidate by
      announcement. A candidate ceases to be a candidate if e ceases to
      be a player during the election or if holding the office would
      make em Overpowered.
      
      An election is contested if it has two or more candidates at the
      end of the nomination period, and uncontested otherwise. For a
      contested election, nominations close at the end of the poll's
      voting period. For an uncontested election, nominations close at
      the end of the nomination period.
      
      In a timely fashion after the nomination period ends, the ADoP CAN
      and SHALL:
      
      1) If the election is contested, initiate an Agoran decision to
      select the winner of the election (the poll). For this decision,
      the Vote Collector is the ADoP, the valid options are the
      candidates for that election (including those who become
      candidates after its initiation), and the voting method is instant
      runoff. When the poll is resolved, its outcome, if a player, wins
      the election. If the outcome is not a player, the election ends
      with no winner.
      
      2) If POSSIBLE per the following paragraph, end the election
      immediately.
      
      If at any point an uncontested election has a single candidate,
      then any player CAN declare them the winner of the election by
      announcement. If at any point an uncontested election has no
      candidates, then any player CAN declare the election ended with no
      winner by announcement.
      
      When a player wins an election, e is installed into the associated
      office and the election ends.

Rule 1551/17 (Power=3.1)
Ratification

      A public document is part (possibly all) of a public message.
      
      When a public document is ratified, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the gamestate is modified to what it would be if,
      at the time the ratified document was published, the gamestate had
      been minimally modified to make the ratified document as true and
      accurate as possible. Such a modification cannot add
      inconsistencies between the gamestate and the rules, and it cannot
      include rule changes unless the ratified document explicitly and
      unambiguously recites either the changes or the resulting
      properties of the rule(s). If no such modification is possible, or
      multiple substantially distinct possible modifications would be
      equally appropriate, the ratification fails.
      
      An internally inconsistent document generally cannot be ratified;
      however, if such a document can be divided into a summary section
      and a main section, where the only purpose of the summary section
      is to summarize information in the main section, and the main
      section is internally consistent, ratification of the document
      proceeds as if it contained only the main section.
      
      Text purportedly about previous instances of ratification (e.g. a
      report's date of last ratification) is excluded from ratification.
      The rules may define additional information that is considered to
      be part of the document for the purposes of ratification; such
      definitions are secured at a Power Threshold of 3.
      
      Ratifying a public document is secured with power threshold 3.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2202/6 (Power=3)
Ratification Without Objection

      Any player CAN, without objection, ratify a public document,
      specifying its scope.
      
      Ratification Without Objection CANNOT cause the repeal, amendment,
      enactment, or mutation of any Rule, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding.
      
      A player SHALL NOT knowingly use or announce intent to use
      Ratification Without Objection to ratify a (prior to ratification)
      document containing incorrect or Indeterminate information when a
      corrected document could be produced with reasonable effort,
      unless the general nature of the document's error and reason for
      ratifying it is clearly and plainly described in the announcement
      of intent. Such ratification or announcement of intent to ratify
      is the Class-8 Crime of Endorsing Forgery.

Rule 2201/7 (Power=3)
Self-Ratification

      A public document defined by the rules as self-ratifying is
      ratified when it is continuously undoubted for one week.
      
      A doubt is an explicit public challenge via one of the following
      methods, identifying a document and explaining the scope and
      nature of a perceived error in it:
      
      1. An inquiry case, appropriate for questions of legal
         interpretation.
      
      2. A claim of error, appropriate for matters of fact. The
         publisher of the original document SHALL (if e was required to
         publish that document) or SHOULD (otherwise) do one of the
         following in a timely fashion:
      
         1. Deny the claim (causing it to cease to be a doubt).
      
         2. Publish a revision.
      
         3. Initiate an inquiry case regarding the truth of the claim
            (if the subject is actually a matter of law), or cite a
            relevant existing inquiry case.

Calls for Judgement
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 991/27 (Power=2)
Calls for Judgement

      Any person (the initiator) can initiate a Call for Judgement (CFJ,
      syn. Judicial Case), specifying a statement to be inquired into by
      announcement.
      
      When a person initiates a Call for Judgment, e CAN optionally bar
      one person from the case by announcement.
      
      At any time, each CFJ is either open (default), suspended, or
      assigned exactly one judgement.
      
      The Arbitor is an office, responsible for the administration of
      justice in a manner that is fair for emself, if not for the rest
      of Agora.
      
      When a CFJ has no judge assigned, the Arbitor CAN assign any
      eligible player to be its judge by announcement, and SHALL do so
      in a timely fashion. The players eligible to be assigned as judge
      are all players except the initiator and the person barred (if
      any). The Arbitor SHALL assign judges over time such that all
      interested players have reasonably equal opportunities to judge.
      If a CFJ has no judge assigned, then any player eligible to judge
      that CFJ CAN assign it to emself Without 3 Objections.
      
      The Arbitor's weekly report includes a summary of recent judicial
      case activity, including open and recently-judged cases, recent
      judicial assignments, and a list of players interested in judging.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 591/45 (Power=1.7)
Delivering Judgements

      When a CFJ is open and assigned to a judge, that judge CAN assign
      a valid judgement to it by announcement, and SHALL do so in a
      timely fashion after this becomes possible. If e does not, the
      Arbitor CAN remove em from being the judge of that case by
      announcement, and SHALL do so in a timely fashion after the time
      limit expires, unless the judge assigns a valid judgement in the
      mean time.
      
      The valid judgements for an inquiry case are as follows, based on
      the facts and legal situation at the time the inquiry case was
      initiated, not taking into account any events since that time:
      
      * FALSE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
        logically false
      
      * TRUE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
        logically true
      
      * IRRELEVANT, appropriate if the veracity of the statement is
        not relevant to the game or is an overly hypothetical
        extrapolation of the game or its rules to conditions that don't
        actually exist, or if it can be trivially determined from the
        outcome of another (possibly still undecided) judicial case that
        was not itself judged IRRELEVANT
      
      * INSUFFICIENT, appropriate if the statement does not come
        with supporting arguments or evidence, and the judge feels as if
        an undue burden is being placed on em by the lack of arguments
        and evidence. A CFJ judged as INSUFFICIENT CAN and SHOULD be
        submitted again with sufficient arguments/evidence.
      
      * DISMISS, appropriate if the statement is malformed, undecidable,
        if insufficient information exists to make a judgement with
        reasonable effort, or the statement is otherwise not able to be
        answered with another valid judgement. DISMISS is not
        appropriate if PARADOXICAL is appropriate.
      
      * PARADOXICAL, appropriate if the statement is logically
        undecidable as a result of a paradox or or other irresovable
        logical situation. PARADOXICAL is not appropriate if IRRELEVANT
        is appropriate, nor is it appropriate if the undecidability
        arises from the case itself or in reference to it.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 911/56 (Power=1.7)
Motions and Moots

      If a judgement has been in effect for less then seven days and has
      not been entered into Moot, then:
      
      - The judge of that CFJ CAN self-file a Motion to Reconsider the
        case by announcement, if e has not already self-filed a Motion
        to Reconsider that CFJ.
      - Any Player CAN group-file a Motion to Reconsider the case with 2
        Support, if the CFJ has not had a Motion to Reconsider
        group-filed for it at any time while it has been assigned to its
        current judge.
      
      When a Motion to Reconsider is so filed, the case is rendered open
      again.
      
      If a CFJ has a judgement assigned, a player CAN enter that
      judgement into Moot with N+2 support, where N is the number of
      weeks since that judgement has been assigned, rounded down. When
      this occurs, the CFJ is suspended, and the Arbitor is once
      authorized to initiate the Agoran decision to determine public
      confidence in the judgement, which e SHALL do in a timely fashion.
      
      For this decision, the vote collector is the Arbitor and the valid
      options are AFFIRM, REMAND, and REMIT. When the decision is
      resolved, the effect depends on the outcome:
      
      - AFFIRM, FAILED QUORUM: The judgement is reassigned to the case,
        and cannot be entered into Moot again.
      
      - REMAND: The case becomes open again.
      
      - REMIT: The case becomes open again, and the current judge is
        recused. The Arbitor SHALL NOT assign em to the case again
        unless no other eligible judges have displayed interest in
        judging.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2175/9 (Power=1)
Judicial Retraction and Excess

      A new case is a judicial case that has not had any judge assigned
      to it. The initiator of a new case CAN retract it by announcement,
      thus causing it to cease to be a judicial case.
      
      An excess case is a new case whose initiator previously initiated
      five or more cases during the same week as that case. A person
      SHALL NOT initiate an excess case. The Arbitor CAN refuse an
      excess case by announcement, thus causing it to cease to be a
      judicial case. When e does so, e fulfills any obligations with
      regards to that case.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2492/2 (Power=1)
Recusal

      A judge CAN recuse emself from a CFJ e is assigned to by
      announcement. When a judge recuses emself from a CFJ, then
      
      * the CFJ becomes unassigned;
      
      * the recused judge becomes ineligible to be assigned as a judge
      * for a week; and
      
      * the recused judge SHOULD suggest another judge for the CFJ to
      * make the Arbitor's job easier.

Rule 2555/0 (Power=2.0)
Blots

      Blots are an indestructible fixed currency with ownership
      restricted to persons. A person with 1 or more blots is Impure, a
      person with 0 blots is Pure. An impure unregistered person is a
      Fugitive.
      
      To Levy a Fine of N on a person, where N is a positive integer, is
      to create N blots in eir possession by announcement. To Expunge a
      blot is to destroy it by announcement. If expunging blots would
      reduce a person's blots to less than 0, their blots are instead
      reduced to 0 but the cost of expunging, if any, is not reduced.
      
      Levying fines and destroying blots are each secured with a power
      threshold of 1.7.
      
      The Referee is an office, and the recordkeepor for blots.

Rule 2478/7 (Power=1.7)
Vigilante Justice

      A player CAN by announcement, but subject to the provisions of
      this rule, Point eir Finger at a person (the perp) who plays the
      game, citing an alleged violation of the rules by that person.
      
      When a player Points a Finger, the investigator SHALL investigate
      the allegation and, in a timely fashion, SHALL conclude the
      investigation by:
      
      - Imposing the Cold Hand of Justice on the perp, as described
      - elsewhere; or
      
      - if e believes that no rules violation occurred or that it would
      - be ILLEGAL to levy a fine for it, announcing the Finger Pointing
      - to be Shenanigans.
      
      The Referee is by default the investigator for all Finger
      Pointing. When a Finger, other than the Arbitor's, is Pointed over
      an allegation related to the official duties or powers of the
      Referee, then the Arbitor CAN, by announcement, take over the
      investigation and thereby become the investigator.
      
      The Referee CANNOT Point eir Finger. The Arbitor CANNOT Point eir

Rule 2531/1 (Power=2)
Referee Accountability

      Any attempt to levy a fine is INEFFECTIVE if it does not include
      (1) value of the fine in blots, (2) the name of the person being
      fined (the perp), and (3) the specific reason for the fine, or if
      it attempts to levy a fine on a person for an action or inaction
      which e (more likely than not) did not commit, or if it attempts
      to levy a fine for an action or inaction which is not prohibited
      by law, or if it attempts to levy a fine with a value which is
      blatantly and obviously unsuited to the conduct which constitutes
      the reason for its levy or to the person to which it is being
      levied, or if it is made more than 14 days after the conduct
      constituting the reason for the fine, or if it attempts to levy a
      fine to a player who has already been levied a fine for the
      conduct constituting the reason for the levy.
      
      If the Referee attempts to levy three or more INEFFECTIVE fines in

Rule 2510/3 (Power=1)
Such is Karma

      Karma is a person switch tracked by the Herald in eir Weekly
      Report. Karma is an Integer switch. Agora also has an instance of
      the Karma switch.
      
      A player CAN publish a Notice of Honour. For a Notice of Honour
      to be valid, it must:
      
      1. Be clear that it is a Notice of Honour, and be the first valid
         Notice of Honour that player has published in the current week;
      
      2. Specify any other player or Agora to gain karma, and provide a
         reason for specifying that player; and
      
      3. Specify any player or Agora to lose karma, and provide a reason
         for specifying that player.
      
      4. Not result in Agora's karma moving farther away from 0.
      
      When a valid Notice of Honour is published, the entity specified
      to gain karma has eir karma increased by one, and the entity
      specified to lose karma has eir karma decreased by one. Raising
      one entity's karma while lowering another's in this manner is
      considered to be a "transfer" of karma.
      
      A player's positions in Court are defined as follows:
      
      - Any player with a karma of 7 or greater is a Samurai.
      
      - Any player with a karma of -7 or less is an Gamma.
      
      - The player with the highest karma (if any) is the Shogun.
      
      - The player with the lowest karma (if any) is the Honourless
        Worm.
      
      Each player's positions in Court are part of of the Herald's

Rule 2529/3 (Power=1)
Medals of Honour

      Medals of Honour are a destructible fixed currency tracked by the

      In the first Eastman week of an Agoran month, any player CAN
      declare emself to be eligible for a Medal of Honour by
      announcement if all of the following are true:
      
      * E has made at least 1 message to a public forum in the last
        Agoran month.
      
      * Eir Karma is not below -3.
      
      * In the last Agoran month, e has not had a fine levied on em.
      
      In the second Eastman week of an Agoran month, if there are any
      players who are eligible for a Medal of Honour, the Herald CAN, by
      announcement, initiate an Agoran Decision on who is to be awarded
      a Medal of Honour. E SHALL do so within the second Eastman week of
      that Agoran month. For this decision, the valid votes are all
      players who are eligible for a Medal of Honour, the vote collector
      is the Herald, and the voting method is instant-runoff. Upon the
      resolution of this decision, the Herald CAN, and SHALL in a timely
      fashion, award the outcome of the decision a Medal of Honour by
      announcement. After a player is awarded a Medal of Honour, all
      players who were previously eligible for a Medal of Honour become
      no longer eligible.
      
      If, at any time, any player has 6 or more Medals of Honour, and e
      has not won via this rule previously, e can win the game by
      announcement, destroying all of eir Medals of Honour.

      been assigned a judgment of PARADOXICAL continuously for at least
      7 days, and e has not done so already in respect of that CFJ, then
      that case's initiator CAN, by announcement, win the game.
      
      A player who wins in this fashion SHOULD submit a proposal to
      prevent the paradox from arising again.

Rule 2554/0 (Power=1)
Zombiception

      If every member of a set of zombies has a master who is a member
      of that set of zombies, then any player CAN announce a
      Zombiception, listing the members of the set. Upon such an
      announcement, all members of the set win the game and have their
      master flipped to Agora.

Rule 2538/0 (Power=2)
Party Favours

      For each Party, there is a currency called Favours in that Party.
      Ownership of Favours is tracked by the Clork. Ownership of Favours
      is restricted to players.
      
      A player CAN, by announcement, spend 3 Favours in a single Party
      to award another player 2 Favours in that Party.
      
      A player CAN, by announcement, spend 3 Favours in a single Party
      to gain a Favour in another specified Party.

Rule 2480/1 (Power=2.1)
Festivals

      Festivity is a singleton switch, whose possible values are
      integers ranging from 0 inclusive to the number of defined types
      of Ribbon exclusive, and defaulting to 0. While Agora's Festivity
      is 0, Festivity is tracked in the Tailor's monthly report.
      Otherwise, it is tracked in the Tailor's weekly report. Changes to
      Festivity are secured.
      
      If Agora's Festivity has had the same nonzero value for 14 days or
      more, any player CAN flip it to 0 by announcement.
      
      A player who owns at least N types of Ribbon CAN Start a Rank N
      Festival, where N is an integer greater than Agora's Festivity,
      with 4 Support from players who own at least N types of Ribbon.
      Upon doing so, Agora's Festivity is flipped to N. Exception: A
      player CANNOT do so if Agora's Festivity has had a value greater
      than or equal to N within the past 21 days.
      
      A person who owns a number of types of Ribbon equal to or greater
      than Agora's Festivity is known as Festive. Other persons are not
      Festive.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2481/1 (Power=2.1)
Festival Restrictions

      While Agora's Festivity is nonzero, the following apply:
      
      1. Non-Festive players are never considered Supporters of a
         dependent action;
      
      2. Non-Festive players cannot flip the Imminence of any proposal;
      
      3. Quorum for Agoran Decisions is equal to half the number of
         Festive players, rounded up;
      
      4. Each Festive player has the maximum possible voting strength.
         All other players have the minimum possible voting strength.
      
      While Agora's Festivity is zero, the paragraphs above have no
      effect and are ignored.

Rule 649/39 (Power=1.5)
Patent Titles

      A Patent Title is a legal title given to a person in recognition
      of the person's distinction. The Herald is an office; its holder
      is responsible for tracking Patent Titles in eir monthly report.
      
      Awarding or revoking a Patent Title is secured at power 1. A
      person permitted and enabled to award (revoke) a Patent Title
      SHALL do so in a timely fashion after the conditions authorizing
      em to do so are announced, unless there is an open judicial case
      contesting the validity of those conditions.
      
      The Herald CAN award a specified Patent Title to a specified
      player With 2 Agoran Consent.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2444/3 (Power=1)
Silver Quill

      The Silver Quill is an annual award designed to honor the authors
      of proposals of outstanding merit and influence on the game.
      
      In a timely fashion after the end of each Agoran Year, the Herald
      SHALL initiate and Agoran Decision to determine which Proposal has
      most greatly influenced that (ending) year of play.
      
      For this decision, the valid options are all proposals adopted
      between November 1 of the year prior to the ending year, and
      October 31 of the ending year. The vote collector is the Herald,
      and the voting method is instant runoff.
      
      Players are ENCOURAGED to discuss which eligible proposals best
      satisfy the aforementioned criteria. Proposals submitted by new
      players SHOULD be given somewhat higher weight, but the primary
      reference should be the proposals themselves and their effect on
      the game since adoption.
      
      Upon the resolution of the decision, if the outcome is not FAILED
      QUORUM and there were at least three votes containing it in any
      preference slot, that proposal wins the Ceremony, and the Herald
      CAN once, by announcement, award its author the Patent Title of
      "Silver Quill YYYY, substituting the ending year; otherwise, there
      is no winner.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2415/0 (Power=1.5)
Badges

      A Badge is any patent title with the word 'badge' as part of its
      name. A badge SHOULD be used to award multiple persons for
      participating in specific event of note within Agora.  Any player
      CAN award a badge that does not yet exist to three or more persons
      simultaneously, with Agoran Consent. The Herald CAN award an
      existing badge to persons Without Objection.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1367/18 (Power=3)
Degrees

      Certain patent titles are known as degrees. The degrees are
      
      - Associate of Nomic                 (A.N.)
      - Bachelor of Nomic                  (B.N.)
      - Master of Nomic                    (M.N.)

      - Doctor of Nomic Philosophy         (D.N.Phil.)
      
      Degrees are ranked in the order they appear in this rule, with
      degrees listed later being ranked higher. A specific degree CANNOT
      be awarded to any person more than once.
      
      A specified degree CAN be awarded with 2 Agoran Consent, and
      SHOULD only be awarded for the publication of an original thesis
      of scholarly worth (including responses to peer-review), published
      with explicit intent to qualify for a degree. The Herald SHOULD
      coordinate the peer-review process and the awarding of degrees.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2231/6 (Power=3)
Order of the Hero of Agora Nomic

      Heroic titles are Agora's premier patent titles of distinction, and
      CAN be awarded to persons for meritorious service only by a
      proposal of power 3 or greater, which SHOULD explain why those
      persons are qualified. Bearers of heroic titles (Heroes) constitute
      the Order of the Hero of Agora Nomic.
      
      The Heroic titles in decreasing precedence are:
      
      Grand Hero of Agora Nomic (GHAN) -- This title CAN be awarded to
      any person obviously and directly responsible for the existence of
      Agora and/or Nomic in general. As this title is the highest honour
      that Agora may bestow, a Bearer of this title OUGHT to be treated
      right good forever.
      
      Hero of Agora Nomic (HAN) -- This title CAN be awarded to any
      person for outstanding meritorious service to Agora above and
      beyond the call of duty.

Rule 103/24 (Power=2)
The Speaker

      The Speaker is an imposed office and the figurehead leader of
      Agora.
      
      The player or players who have most recently won the game are
      called Laureled. If at any time the office of Speaker is vacant,
      or when one or more players win Agora, then the Prime Minister CAN
      and SHALL, once and in a timely fashion, appoint a Laureled player
      to the office of Speaker by announcement.
      
      If the office of Speaker has been held continuously by the same
      person for 90+ days, then any player CAN appoint another player to
      the office with Support.
      
      For an election of the Prime Minister, the Speaker has voting
      strength one greater than e would have if e did not hold the
      office.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2423/3 (Power=2)
First Among Equals

      The Prime Minister is an office. The Prime Minister is elected by
      the players of Agora primarily on account of not being the other
      guy. The Prime Minister SHOULD ensure that Agoran affairs proceed
      smoothly.
      
      The holder of the office of Prime Minister's voting strength is
      increased by 1 on all Agoran decisions other than a elections of
      the Prime Minister.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2463/0 (Power=1)
Motion of No Confidence

      Any player can cause the office of Prime Minister to become vacant
      with 2 Agoran Consent by publishing a message with the character
      string "MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE" in the subject line.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2451/6 (Power=2.0)
Executive Orders

      Once per week and except as otherwise forbidden by this rule, the
      current Prime Minister CAN issue a Cabinet Order by announcement
      to perform the action(s) authorized by that Order.
      
      Each Cabinet Order is associated with an office. The current Prime
      Minister CANNOT issue more than one Cabinet Order associated with
      the same office more than once in the same month, nor can e issue
      a Cabinet Order associated with a vacant office.
      
      The available Cabinet Orders are:
      
      - Certiorari (Arbitor): The Prime Minister assigns emself as judge
        of a specified open case.
      
      - Dive (Referee): The Prime Minister levies a 2 Blot fine on a
        specified player. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the
        reason for the fine MAY be any grievance held by the Prime
        Minister, not necessarily a violation of the rules, against the
        person to whom the fine is levied.
      
      - Manifesto (Promotor): The Prime Minister distributes a specified
        proposal in the Proposal Pool.

Contracts & Obligations
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2450/3 (Power=1.7)
Pledges

      Pledges are an indestructible fixed asset. Ownership of pledges is
      restricted to persons. The Referee is the recordkeepor of pledges.
      Creating, destroying, modifying, and transferring pledges are
      secured.
      
      To "pledge" something is to create a pledge with those terms. A
      person CAN pledge by announcement to create a pledge e owns.
      
      To "retract" (syn "withdraw") a pledge is to destroy it. A person
      CAN retract a pledge e owns without objection.
      
      To "call in" a pledge" is to destroy it. A player CAN call in any
      pledge with Agoran Consent, if e announces a reason the Terms of
      the pledge should be considered broken. Support for an intent to
      call in a pledge is INEFFECTIVE unless the supporting player
      explicitly confirms the reasons that the pledge should be
      considered broken.
      
      It is ILLEGAL to own a pledge when it is called in.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2519/0 (Power=3)
Consent

      A person gives consent (syn. consents) to an action when e, acting
      as emself, publicly states that e agrees to the action. This
      agreement may be implied, but only if it is reasonably clear from
      context that the person wanted the agreement to take place.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2520/0 (Power=2.5)
Contracts

      A contract is a ruleset-defined entity embodied in text. An entity
      can only become a contract through the appropriate ruleset defined
      procedures. Changes to the contract's text by rule defined
      mechanisms (including those delegated to the contract itself) do
      not change the identity of the contract.
      
      If any change to a contract's text, internal state, or other
      properties would cause them to become indeterminate and remain so
      for any non-infinitesimal amount of time, the change is canceled
      and does not occur.
      
      The following changes are secured at power 2.1: creating or
      modifying a contract or causing an entity to become a contract. 
      
      The properties of contracts, as defined by other rules, include
      the following:
      
      - Parties, persons who agree to be bound by and assume powers
        under the contract.
      
      - The ability to be amended or destroyed.
      
      - The ability to compel actions by their parties.
      
      - The ability to allow persons to take actions on the part of
        their parties.
      
      - The ability to define arbitrary classes of asset.
      
      - The ability to possess and control assets.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2525/1 (Power=2.6)
Interpreting Contracts

      A contract should generally be interpreted according to its text,
      including any clauses giving directions for its interpretation or
      construction. Additionally, justice, the intent of the contract's
      parties, and the principles governing rule interpretation should
      be reasonably applied when interpreting a contract.
      
      A contract is subservient to the rules. Although a contract may
      specify obligations or powers beyond those created by the rules, a
      contract may not override the rules: in particular, any provision
      of a contract that would unreasonably violate an inalienable right
      of players and/or persons or cause any rule defined statement
      about the gamestate, or about the possibility of an action, to
      become false is void and without effect insofar as it does so.
      
      The following are protected actions:
      
      1. Registering and deregistering;
      
      2. Submitting, pending, or voting freely on a proposal, but only
         if the sole effect the proposal would have if adopted is to
         create, modify, or destroy a contract or group of contracts, or
         to cause an entity or group of entities to become or cease to
         be a contract or group of contracts;
      
      3. Creating, destroying, or amending a contract, intending to do
         so, and supporting, objecting to, or resolving such an intent,
         except where the mechanism for destruction or amendment is
         created by the contract itself;
      
      4. Making true statements about a contract;
      
      5. Calling, judging, assigning, or freely discussing a CFJ;
      
      6. Objecting to or supporting an intent to perform an action while
         Speaker;
      
      7. Using an executive order;
      
      8. Making, amending, revoking or calling in a pledge; and
      
      9. Any action affecting the status of a festival.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a contract CANNOT compel,
      forbid, or in any significant way alter, tamper with, or modify
      the performance of a protected action. A contract CANNOT punish a
      player for performing or failing to perform a protected action, or
      for doing so in a particular manner, except where it would
      otherwise be ILLEGAL. A contract also CANNOT enable a person to do
      any of the things prohibited to the contract by this paragraph.
      Insofar as a contract or a provision or clause of a contract
      contravenes the letter or clear intent of this rule, it is void
      and without effect.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2522/1 (Power=2.5)
Contract Lifecycle

      A person CAN create a contract by announcement by transferring 1
      coin to Agora, specifying the contract's text. A person SHALL NOT
      create more than X (where X is the contract limit) contracts per
      week by this method, and the Notary CAN destroy any excess (i.e.
      beyond the X permitted) contracts by announcement within 7 days of
      the contract's formation, but only if the contract(s) were excess
      at the time of their creation.
      
      The contract limit is an untracked singleton switch, defaulting to
      3, with possible values of any integer between 3 and 7. The
      contract limit can be set to any valid value in a regulation
      promulgated by the Notary. The amendment limit is an untracked
      singleton switch, with possible values of integers greater than or
      equal to 5, or positive infinity (default). The amendment limit
      can be set in a regulation promulgated by the Notary.
      
      The person or persons who create a contract CAN and SHOULD also
      specify a name for the contract; if e does not do so, the Notary
      CAN and SHALL assign a name in a timely fashion.
      
      A contract CAN amend, destroy, or retitle itself by announcement.
      A player CAN amend, destroy, or retitle a contract without
      objection, even if its text denies em the ability to do so.
      Players SHOULD only use this mechanism to recover from situations
      where the contract is underspecified or has unintended effects.
      
      The Notary CAN by regulation stop the same contract from amending
      or retitling itself more than Y times (where Y is the amendment
      limit limit) combined times per Agoran day; e CANNOT stop a
      contract from being destroyed, or from being retitled or amended
      by any other means.
      
      If a contract has fulfilled its purpose, does not specify any
      gamestate affecting statements, or otherwise seems unlikely to be
      used, the Notary CAN and SHOULD destroy it with Agoran Consent.
      Any player CAN destroy a contract with 2 Agoran Consent. Players
      SHOULD NOT use the methods in this paragraph to further their
      private interests.
      
      If the possibility of any action defined by this rule is
      indeterminate, or is subject to a inextricable conditional, it is
      impossible.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2523/2 (Power=2.4)
Contracts as Agreements

      The text of a contract can specify obligations upon its parties.
      Parties to a contract SHALL abide by its terms, breaching them
      neither negligently nor deliberately. The fact that the action
      described by the contract is in violation of the rules is not a
      defense if the violative nature is reasonably clear from its text.
      If whether an action is permitted, forbidden, required, or made
      optional by a contract is indeterminate or subject to an
      inextricable conditional, it is presumptively permitted.
      
      As an exception to the provisions of the previous paragraph and
      the circumstances in which fines would ordinarily be appropriate,
      a person levying a fine under this rule MAY and CAN validly
      consider the equitable interests of justice and interests of the
      game, including the importance of the observation of contracts, as
      a mitigating or aggravating circumstances when levying a fine.
      Such a person MAY, CAN validly, and SHOULD also consider the
      instructions of the contract or contracts in question when levying
      a fine.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2521/0 (Power=2.5)
Parties to Contracts

      Each contract has an associated set of persons, known as the
      parties. The person who creates a contract is automatically a
      party. Other persons CAN become parties to a contract by
      announcement if the contract's text permits them to do so. Parties
      can leave a contract by announcement, ceasing being parties, if
      the contract's text permits them to do so. A contract CAN expel a
      party or group of parties by announcement, causing them to cease
      being parties.
      
      It is IMPOSSIBLE, by any means, for a person to become a party to
      a contract, for an contract to be created with a person as a
      party, or for an entity to become a contract with a person as a
      party, without that person's consent. This rule takes precedence
      over any rule that might make such a change
      possible.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2526/2 (Power=2.4)
Sustenance Payments

      The Notary CAN, once a month, cause each contract that owns at
      least one coin to transfer one coin to Agora. E SHALL do so in the
      first Eastman week of every month. If a contract does not own at
      least one coin, and is thus unable to make said payment, the
      Notary CAN and SHALL destroy it With Notice. If a contract becomes
      and remains able to pay before its destruction, the Notary CANNOT
      destroy it, and CAN and SHALL instead collect the coin.
      
      The Notary CAN, by regulation, exempt a contract from the
      preceding paragraph. E SHALL NOT do so unless the contract seems
      to be in the public interest of Agora.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2527/0 (Power=1)
The Notary

      The Notary is an office, and the recordkeepor of contracts. The
      Notary's weekly report contains all contracts, including their
      name, text, and parties. The Notary's weekly report also contains
      the list of private classes of asset. The Notary is ENCOURAGED to
      list all changes to the information e tracks in eir report.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2471/1 (Power=1)
No Faking

      A person SHALL NOT make a public statement that is a lie. A
      statment is a lie if its publisher either knew or believed it to
      be not to be true at the time e published it (or, in the case of
      an action, not to be effective), and it was made with the intent
      to mislead. Merely quoting a statement does not constitute making
      it for the purposes of this rule. Any disclaimer, conditional
      clause, or other qualifier attached to a statement constitutes
      part of the statement for the purposes of this rule; the truth or
      falsity of the whole is what is significant.
      
      The previous provisions of this rule notwithstanding, a formal
      announcement of intent is never a lie.

Rule 2166/25 (Power=3)
Assets

      An asset is an entity defined as such by a (a) rule, (b)
      authorized regulation, (c) group of rules and/or authorized
      regulations (but if such regulations modify a preexisting asset
      class defined by a rule or another title of regulations, they must
      be authorized specifically to do so by their parent rule), or (d)
      contract (hereafter its backing document), and existing solely
      because its backing document defines its existence. An asset's
      backing document can specify when and how that asset is created,
      destroyed, and transferred.
      
      Each asset has exactly one owner. If an asset would otherwise lack
      an owner, it is owned by Agora. If an asset's backing document
      restricts its ownership to a class of entities, then that asset
      CANNOT be gained by or transferred to an entity outside that
      class, and is destroyed if it is owned by an entity outside that
      class (except if it is owned by Agora, in which case any player
      CAN transfer or destroy it without objection). The restrictions in
      the previous sentence are subject to modification by its backing
      document.
      
      Unless modified by an asset's backing document, ownership of an
      asset is restricted to Agora, players, and contracts. As an
      exception to the last sentence, non-player persons are generally
      able to own assets defined by a contract they are a party to,
      subject to modification by the contract in question.
      
      A contract's text can specify whether or not that contract is
      willing to receive assets or a class of assets. Generally, a
      contract CANNOT be given assets it is unwilling to receive. If the
      contract is silent on the matter, or if its willingness is
      indeterminate or the subject of a inextricable conditional, the
      procedure to determine its willingness is as follows:
      
        1. If the contract appears to anticipate being given assets,
           other than for sustenance (e.g. by authorizing parties to
           spend the contract's assets), then the contract is willing to
           receive all assets.
      
        2. Otherwise, it is unwilling to receive all assets.
      
      The previous paragraph (including the list) notwithstanding, a
      contract CAN be given 1 unit of Agora’s official currency a month
      for its sustenance payment, so long as it never has more than 1
      unit of Agora’s official currency at a time.
      
      The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity (if any)
      defined as such by, and bound by, its backing document. That
      entity's report includes a list of all instances of that class and
      their owners. This portion of that entity's report is
      self-ratifying. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a contract
      CANNOT oblige a person who isn't a member to record its internal
      state, nor is the default recordkeepor responsible for tracking a
      contract's internal state. For the purposes of this rule, the
      promulgator of a regulation is bound by it.
      
      An asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner by announcement,
      subject to modification by its backing document. An indestructible
      asset is one defined as such by it backing document, and CANNOT be
      destroyed except by a proposal or rule, other than this one,
      specifically addressing the destruction of indestructible assets
      or that asset in particular; any other asset is destructible. In
      circumstances where another asset would be destroyed, an
      indestructible asset is generally transferred to Agora, subject to
      modification by its backing document and the intervention of other
      rules.
      
      To "lose" an asset is to have it destroyed from one's possession;
      to "revoke" an asset from an entity is to destroy it from that
      entity's possession.
      
      An asset generally CAN be transferred (syn. paid, given) by
      announcement by its owner to another entity, subject to
      modification by its backing document. A fixed asset is one defined
      as such by its backing document, and CANNOT be transferred; any
      other asset is liquid.
      
      When a rule indicates transferring an amount that is not a natural
      number, the specified amount is rounded up to the nearest natural
      number.
      
      A currency is a class of asset defined as such by its backing
      document. Instances of a currency with the same owner are
      fungible.
      
      The "x balance of an entity", where x is a currency, is the number
      of x that entity possesses. If a rule, proposal, or other
      competent authority attempts to increase or decrease the balance
      of an entity without specifying a source or destination, then the
      currency is created or destroyed as needed.
      
      When a player causes one or more balances to change, e is
      ENCOURAGED to specify the resulting balance(s). Players SHOULD NOT
      specify inaccurate balances.
      
      Where it resolves ambiguity, the asset or currency being referred
      to is the currency designated as "Agora's official currency", if
      there is one.
      
      An asset or class of assets is private, rather than public, if its
      backing document is a contract.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2515/0 (Power=1)
Distributing Assets

      To “distribute” a quantity of a fungible asset to a set of
      recipients is to transfer one instance of that asset at a time to
      the recipient that owns the least number of instances of that
      asset, until either no more instances of the asset are eligible to
      be distributed, or the number of instances so transferred equals
      the quantity to be distributed. If, when distributing a specific
      asset, two or more recipients each own the least number of
      instances of that asset, then the recipient that most recently
      became eligible to own the asset SHALL receive the asset being
      distributed.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2545/0 (Power=2)
Auctions

      An Auction is a way for entities to give away items in exchange
      for a currency. Any rule or contract CAN permit (or require)
      Auctions to be initiated.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2546/0 (Power=1)
Lots

      Each Auction has one or more lots of items.
      
      A lot is a non-empty list of items to be transferred by a single
      Auction to a single recipient.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2547/0 (Power=1)
The Auctioneer

      Each Auction has an Auctioneer.
      
      The Auctioneer of an Auction is the entity that initiates that
      Auction, and describes all of the specifics of an Auction. All
      rules or contracts permitting Auctions to be initiated should
      specify an entity to be Auctioneer. If no Auctioneer is specified,
      the default Auctioneer for Auctions defined by the rules is Agora,
      and the default Auctioneer for Auctions defined by a contract is
      the contract itself.
      
      A clause in a Contract purporting to make an entity which is
      neither the Contract itself nor a party to the Contract the
      Auctioneer of an Auction defined by that Contract is INEFFECTIVE.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2548/0 (Power=1)
The Auction Announcer

      Each Auction has an Announcer. Only persons can be Announcers.
      
      If the Auctioneer of an Auction is a player, then that player is
      the Announcer of that Auction.
      
      Otherwise, the rule or contract defining an Auction CAN define the
      Announcer for that Auction. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding,
      no Contract can define a person as the Announcer of an Auction
      unless that person is a party to that Contract.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2549/1 (Power=1)
Auction Initiation

      An entity authorized by a rule or contract to initiate an Auction
      CAN do so by announcement. If the rule or contract specifies that
      that entity MUST do so, that entity SHALL do so in a timely
      fashion. An Auction CANNOT be initiated other than as described by
      a rule or contract.
      
      An Auction CANNOT be initiated unless the announcer specifies all
      of
      
      * the Auction's lots, in the order they will be awarded,
      
      * the items in each lot,
      
      * the Auction's Auctioneer,
      
      * the Auction's Announcer,
      
      * the Auction's minimum bid, and, optionally
      
      * the Auction's currency
      
      in the message initiating the Auction. An Auction also CANNOT be
      initiated unless the Auctioneer is able to give away each item in
      each of the Auction's lots.
      
      If no currency is specified, it defaults to coins.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2550/0 (Power=1)
Bidding

      A person authorized to bid on an Auction CAN do so by
      announcement, specifying the amount of the Auction's currency to
      bid. A bid placed on an Auction before it is initiated, or after
      it has ended, is INEFFECTIVE.
      
      An attempt to place a bid which is less than the Auction's minimum
      bid is INEFFECTIVE.
      
      A person CAN withdraw their bid on an Auction by announcement. If
      a person submits a bid on an Auction, all bids previously placed
      on that Auction by that person are withdrawn.
      
      A rule or contract defining an Auction CAN specify a class of
      players who are authorized to bid on that Auction. If the rule or
      contract does not specify a class of authorized bidders, any
      player is authorized to bid on an Auction defined by a rule, and
      any party to a contract is authorized to bid an Auction defined by
      that Contract.
      
      A person SHALL NOT bid on an Auction if it would be impossible for
      em to pay that amount at the conclusion of the Auction.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2551/0 (Power=1)
Auction End

      An Auction ends 7 days after its initiation, or immediately if no
      bid has been placed or withdrawn in the last 96 hours, or
      immediately if it is terminated.
      
      When an Auction ends, any bid placed by an entity which does not
      own enough of the Auction's currency to pay the amount specified
      in the bid is automatically withdrawn.
      
      Once an Auction has ended, any further attempts to bid on that
      Auction or to withdraw bids from that Auction are INEFFECTIVE.
      
      Once the Auction has ended, the Auction's announcer SHALL announce
      the end of the Auction in a timely fashion. In the same message, e
      SHALL include the a list of all the bids on the Auction and the
      winner(s) (if there are any) of the Auction.
      
      A person's priority on an Auction is their position in the list of
      persons who have bid on the Auction, sorted by the value of their
      non-withdrawn bids in descending order. If two persons have placed
      non-withdrawn bids for the same value, a player who placed their
      non-withdrawn bid first has a higher priority than a player who
      placed their non-withdrawn bid at a later time.
      
      For each lot in the Auction, the winner of that lot is the player
      with the highest priority on the Auction who has not won any
      previous lot. If there are more lots than there are persons with
      non-withdrawn bids, the excess lots are not won by any person.
      
      The winner of a lot SHALL pay the Auctioneer the number of the
      Auction's currency equal to eir bid, in a single payment, in a
      timely fashion. When e does so, the Auctioneer SHALL transfer the
      items in that lot to that winner in a timely fashion. If the
      Auctioneer is not a person, then a person authorized to cause the
      Auctioneer to transfer those items SHALL do so in a timely fashion
      after the winner pays the Auctioneer, instead.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2552/0 (Power=1)
Auction Termination

      Any player CAN terminate an Auction, by announcement, if the
      Auction has not ended and the Auctioneer of that Auction cannot
      transfer any item included in a lot in that Auction.
      
      When an Auction is terminated, all bids on that Auction are
      withdrawn, and then the Auction ends immediately.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2483/7 (Power=2)
Economics

      The following currencies are defined, and are tracked by the
      Treasuror. They can be owned by Agora, players, contracts, and
      facilities.
      
      1. ore
      2. stones
      3. lumber
      4. apples
      5. cotton
      6. corn
      7. coins
      8. papers
      9. fabric
      
      Stones, apples, and corn are considered unrefinable currencies;
      ore, lumber, and cotton are considered refinable currencies; and
      coins, papers, and fabric are considered refined currencies.
      
      Coins are the official currency of Agora.

Paydays

      Whenever a Payday occurs, the following events happen in order:
      
      1. The following assets are created in the possession of each
         player:
         A. 10 coins
         B. 5 apples
         C. 2 papers
      
      2. For each office, if a single player held that office for 16 or
         more days in the previous month and no unforgivable fines were
         levied on em for eir conduct in that office during that time,
         the following assets are created in the possession of that
         player:
         A. 5 coins
         B. 1 corn
      
      The occurrence of Paydays is secured.  At the beginning of each
      month, a Payday occurs.

========================================================================
The Land of Arcadia
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1993/1 (Power=2)
The Land of Arcadia

      Arcadia is a land entirely defined by the Arcadian Map (the Map).
      The Map is the term for the set of all Land Units.
      
      The Map divides Arcadia into a finite, discrete number of Units of
      Land, or simply Land. Each Unit of Land is an indestructible asset
      specified by an ordered pair of integers known as its Latitude and
      Longitude.
      
      Every unique ordered pair of integers within the limits defined in
      the Rules for Latitude and Longitude signifies an existent Unit of
      Land. No other Units of Land exist. Units of Land CAN only be
      created or destroyed by changing the limits of Latitude and
      Longitude defined in the Rules.
      
      All values for Latitude and Longitude MUST lie between -6 and +6,
      inclusive.
      
      The Total Land Area of Arcadia is the number of existent Units of
      Land defined by permissible Latitude and Longitude pairs.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1994/0 (Power=2)
Ownership of Land

      Any existent Land for which ownership has not been explicitly
      changed belongs to Agora.
      
      Land belonging to Agora is called Public Land. Land belonging to
      a contract is called Communal Land. Land belonging to any other
      entity is called Private Land. Together, Communal Land and Private
      Land are called Proprietary Land.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1995/1 (Power=2)
Land Types

      Each Unit of Land has a Land Type switch, tracked by the
      Cartographor, whose values are "Black", "White", "Gray" and
      "Aether" (the default). Changes to Land Type switches are secured.
      To "change the type" of, or to "transform" a Unit of Land is to
      flip its Type switch. A "Unit of X" is a Unit of Land whose Land
      Type switch has the value X.
      
      When existent Land has not had its Type changed as explicitly
      permitted by the Rules, or has a Type that is not currently
      defined by the Rules, it is considered to have the Land Type of
      Aether. Rules to the contrary nonwithstanding, Units of Aether
      CANNOT be transferred from Agora, or owned by any entity other
      than Agora.
      
      If Proprietary Land becomes Aether, the Cartographor SHALL
      transfer it to Agora in a timely fashion, destroy any facilities
      on the Land Unit, and set all other switches on the Land Unit to
      their default values.
      
      Type is a singleton switch with the values of Black and White,
      defaulting to Black. When an act specifies that an alternating
      land type is to be used, the current value of the Alternating Land
      Type switch is used, and the switch is set to the next value of
      the switch.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1996/3 (Power=1)
The Cartographor

      The Cartographor is an office; its holder is recordkeepor for the
      Land of Arcadia.
      
      The Cartographor's Weekly Report shall include:
      
      1. the ownership and land type of all existing land;
      2. all changes in the ownership and land type of existing land
         since the most recent report;
      3. the location for the previous week and the current week of each
         entity with a defined location;
      4. the next alternating land type;
      5. all facilities and their parent land units; and
      6. a list of all preserved land units.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1998/2 (Power=1)
Land Topology

      Two Units of Land are Adjacent if they have the same Latitude, and
      their Longitudes differ by exactly one; or they have the same
      Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by exactly one.
      
      Land Unit A is said to be connected to Land Unit B if it is
      possible to reach B by moving only to adjacent Land Units of the
      same color, starting from A.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1999/0 (Power=1)
Entity Location

      Location is a player switch, tracked by the Cartographer, whose
      values are ordered pairs of integers where the first value is a
      valid Latitude, and the second is a valid Longitude. The default
      Location is (0, 0).
      
      To "move" a player is to flip that player’s Location switch to the
      Latitude and Longitude of the destination.
      
      No other Entity can have a location unless it is defined in a rule
      other than this one. Changes to the Location of an Entity are
      secured. If an Entity is specified by this Rule as having a
      defined Location, but its Location has not been explicitly set or
      changed, its Location is set to (0, 0).
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2003/12 (Power=1)
Actions in Arcadia

      Players CAN destroy:
      
      1. 1 apple to move from one Land Unit to an adjacent Unit if their
         Land Types are the same or one of them is gray, and the
         destination is not Aether;
      
      2. 2 apples to move from one Land Unit to an adjacent Unit if
         their Land Types differ, neither is gray, and the destination
         is not Aether;
      
      3. 2 apples to set Land Type of a Land Unit which e owns to any
         Land Type other than Aether, whether or not e is located at
         that Land Unit.
      
      4. 3 apples to set the Land Type of a Land Unit that is adjacent
         to the Entity's current location, is of type Aether, and is
         owned by Agora, to an alternating Land Type.
      
      5. 4 apples to set the Land Type of a Land Unit that is adjacent
         to the Entity's current location, is of type Aether, and is
         owned by Agora, to a Land Type of eir choice.
      
      6. 6 apples to set the Land Type of a Land Unit that is of type
         Aether, and is owned by Agora, to an alternating Land Type.
      
      Players CAN, while performing the above actions, substitute 3
      apples for 1 corn.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2004/4 (Power=1)
Land Auctions

      Every Agoran Week, if the number of units of Private Land is less
      than one half the total number of units of Land, the Cartographor
      CAN and SHALL initiate an auction. For this auction, the announcer
      is the Cartographor, the auctioneer is Agora, the lots are chosen
      as such:
      
      1. if there exist at least 5 Units of non-Aether Land in the
         possession of Agora with the preservation switch set to False:
         any 5 such Units of Land, to be chosen by the Cartographor,
         each Land Unit in a separate lot;
      
      2. if there exist fewer than 5 Units of non-Aether Land in the
         possession of Agora: all such Units, each land unit in a
         separate lot;
      
      and the minimum bid is 1 coin.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2022/6 (Power=1)
Land Transfiguration

      Once during the second or third Eastman week of each Agoran Month,
      the Cartographor CAN perform the following actions in sequence,
      and report these changes:
      
      1. Every Land Unit, with a preservation switch of False
         that is not directly connected to a unit of Aether, or is not
         connected by its own type to a unit of Aether, shall be
         transformed to Aether.
      
      2. Any entities whose locations are on land units so transformed
         shall have their locations set to (0, 0).
      
      3. If any land unit so transformed is not property of Agora, it
         becomes property of Agora.
      
      The Cartographor SHALL do so in the second Eastman week of each
      Agoran Month.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2565/0 (Power=2.6)
Preserved Land

      Preservation is a boolean land switch, defaulting to False. The
      preservation switch CAN be set in a regulation promulgated by the
      Cartographor without 2 objections. A Land Unit with its
      preservation switch set to True is considered a preserved Land
      Unit. A Land Unit with its preservation switch set to False is
      considered an unconserved Land Unit.
      
      Changes to the Land Type or ownership of a preserved land unit
      are secured at a power threshold of 2.5.
      
      Any Facilities built on a preserved land unit CANNOT have their
      rank changed or be destroyed, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding.
      
      Whenever a land unit becomes preserved, it is transferred to
      Agora. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, entities that are
      not Agora CANNOT own preserved land.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2560/1 (Power=2)
Facilities

      Facilities are liquid assets tracked by the Cartographor. In order
      for a facility to exist, it must be built on a Land Unit. Only one
      facility is allowed per Land Unit. The Land Unit on which a
      Facility is built is considered its Parent Land Unit.
      
      A player CAN create a facility by announcement on the land unit e
      is on by specifying which type of facility e intends to build and
      destroying the build cost. Facilities on proprietary land can be
      destroyed by the owner by announcement. Facilities on public land
      can be destroyed Without Objection.
      
      If an entity other than Agora owns any facilities with upkeep
      costs, e must pay them before the first day of the next Agoran
      month. Failing to do this destroys the facility. In the second to
      last Eastman week of the Agoran Month, the Cartographor SHOULD
      issue a humiliating public reminder to all those who have not paid
      upkeep fees on any of eir facilities.
      
      Facilities always have the same owner as their parent land unit.
      If the owner of a facility is ever not the same as that of its
      parent land unit, it is transferred to the owner of its parent
      land unit.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2561/2 (Power=2)
Asset Generation with Facilities

      When an Production or Processing facility creates assets, the
      assets are added to the facility's possession. The rule that
      creates an Production or Processing facility CAN specify a
      carrying capacity for assets. If, at any time, the amount of an
      asset in the possession of an Production or Processing facility
      exceeds that asset's carrying capacity, an amount of that asset is
      destroyed until the amount of that asset in the possession of the
      facility is equal to its carrying capacity.
      
      At the end of every Agoran Week, Agora creates a number of assets
      in a Production facility specified by the rule which creates the
      facility.
      
      At the end of every Agoran Week, Agora destroys any refinable
      assets in the possession of each Processing facility that that
      facility can change into refined assets and replaces them with a
      corresponding number of refined assets to be specified by the rule
      that creates the facility.
      
      A player can take a number of assets from an Production or
      Processing facility's inventory by announcement if eir location is
      the same as the facility's and the following criteria are met:
         1. if the facility is built on unconserved Public Land, none.
         2. if the facility is built on preserved Public Land and less
            than four days have passed since assets were created in the
            facility most recently, e must not have taken any assets
            from the inventory of another facility located on a

      Unit whose Land Type is not an element of their Allowed Land
      Types. If an action or set of actions would cause a facility to be
      created with a Parent Land Unit whose Land Type is not an element
      of its Allowed Land Types, that action or set of actions fails. I
      a facility's Parent Land Unit's Land Type is flipped to a color
      that is not in that facility's Allowed Land Types, that facility
      is destroyed.

Rule 1727/21 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;
      
      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial Rulesets
      of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets of Nomic
      World and other nomics,
      
      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June 30,
      1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by FIRST SPEAKER
      Michael Norrish, which read, in part,
      
        "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
        precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think we may
        as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules are invited.
        In accordance with the rules, these will be published, numbered
        and distributed by me at my earliest convenience."
      
      And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic,
      known unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was played
      on, until its Players, much later, gave it its OFFICIAL NAME of
      Agora,
      
      And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest, and
      most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the hard work
      and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent advice of
      Agoraphobes,
      
      And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
      founding,
      
      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2464/3 (Power=1)
Tournaments

      A Tournament is a sub-game of Agora specifically sanctioned to be
      initiated as a tournament by the Rules. If a winner of a
      tournament is determined within within 3 months of its initiation,
      that person or persons win the game, otherwise the tournament
      concludes with no winner. A Tournament is governed by a special
      temporary title of the ACORN, created in accordance with its
      parent rule, which have binding control over those who freely
      agree to play the tournament and over the tournament itself. Once
      the tournament is concluded, these regulations cease to have any
      effect, and CAN be repealed by any player by announcement. The
      person who initiates a tournament is its Gamemaster.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2566/0 (Power=1)
Free Tournaments

      A player who is not the gamemaster of an existing tournament CAN
      initiate a sanctioned tournament with a specified set of
      regulations with 2 Agoran Consent. A tournament created using this
      method is called a Free Tournament. Rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, only players CAN win the game via a free
      tournament.
      
      A free tournament CAN be concluded with no winner without 3
      objections. Tournaments SHOULD only be concluded in this manner if
      it is clear that its regulations are malformed or contrary to the
      tournament's intent or that it is IMPOSSIBLE for any player to win
      the tournament.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2495/1 (Power=1)
The Birthday Tournament

      In a timely fashion after the start of June 1 of each year, the
      Herald SHALL propose a set of Regulations governing a Birthday
      Tournament for that year; the Herald CAN also delegate the
      responsibility for creating or running the tournament to another
      player, with that player's consent, by announcement.
      
      The Birthday Tournament's regulations SHOULD be such that all
      persons who choose to participate have a fair chance of winning
      the tournament (according to its regulations), and a winner
      SHOULD be expected within 2-3 weeks following the tournament's
      initiation.
      
      After adequate time for discussion of the Birthday Tournament's
      regulations, the Herald (or delegate) CAN initiate a sanctioned
      tournament with a specified, finalized set of regulations,
      Without 3 Objections. By doing so e promulgates those regulations
      as a special temporary title of the ACORN. This title may
      thereafter be amended only by the Herald or eir designee without
      objection, to correct minor typos. The initiation SHOULD be timed
      to coincide with Agora's Birthday.

      The period each year from midnight GMT on the morning of 24
      December to the beginning of the first Agoran week to begin after
      2 January is a Holiday.
      
      The week that contains the beginning of Agora's Birthday,
      together with the following week, is a Holiday.
