Agora
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 101/17 (Power=3)
The Game of Agora

      Agora is a game of Nomic, wherein Persons, acting in accordance
      with the Rules, communicate their game Actions and/or results of
      these actions via Fora in order to play the game.  The game may
      be won, but the game never ends.

      Please treat Agora Right Good Forever.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1698/4 (Power=3)
Agora Is A Nomic

      Agora is ossified if it is IMPOSSIBLE for any reasonable combination of
      actions by players to cause arbitrary rule changes to be made and/or
      arbitrary proposals to be adopted within a four-week period.

      If, but for this rule, the net effect of a proposal would cause Agora to
      become ossified, or would cause Agora to cease to exist, it cannot take
      effect, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.If any other single change
      to the gamestate would cause Agora to become ossified, or would cause
      Agora to cease to exist, it is cancelled and does not occur, rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 478/34 (Power=3)
Fora

      Freedom of speech being essential for the healthy functioning of
      any non-Imperial nomic, it is hereby resolved that no Player
      shall be prohibited from participating in the Fora, nor shall
      any person create physical or technological obstacles that
      unduly favor some players' fora access over others.

      Publicity is a forum switch with values Public, Discussion, and
      Foreign (default), tracked by the Registrar.  Changes to
      publicity are secured.

      The Registrar may change the publicity of a forum without
      objection as long as:

      1. e sends eir announcement of intent to that forum; and

      2. if the forum is to be made public, the announcement by which
         the Registrar makes that forum public is sent to all
         existing public fora.

      Each player should ensure e can receive messages via each public
      forum.

      A public message is a message sent via a public forum, or sent
      to all players and containing a clear designation of intent to
      be public.  A rule can also designate that a part of one public
      message is considered a public message in its own right. A
      person "publishes" or "announces" something by sending a public
      message.

      Where the rules define an action that CAN be performed "by
      announcement", a person performs that action by unambiguously
      and clearly specifying the action and announcing that e performs
      it.  Any action performed by sending a message is performed at
      the time date-stamped on that message. Actions in messages
      (including sub-messages) are performed in the order they appear
      in the message, unless otherwise specified.

Rule 869/39 (Power=3)
How to Join and Leave Agora

      Any organism that is generally capable of freely originating and
      communicating independent thoughts and ideas is a person.  Rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding, no other entities are persons.

      Citizenship is a person switch with values Unregistered
      (default) and Registered, tracked by the Registrar.  Changes to
      citizenship are secured.  A registered person is a Player.

      A person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or prevented by the
      rules) register by publishing a message that indicates
      reasonably clearly and reasonably unambiguously that e intends
      to become a player at that time.  A person, by registering,
      agrees to abide by the Rules.  The Rules CANNOT otherwise bind a
      person to abide by any agreement without that person's willful
      consent.

      A player CAN deregister (cease being a player) by announcement.
      If e does so, e CANNOT register by announcement for 30 days.

      If a player has not sent a message to a public forum in the last
      month, then any player CAN deregister em without objection.

      The Rules CANNOT compel non-players to act, nor compel players
      to unduly harass non-players.  A non-person CANNOT be a player,
      rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2139/9 (Power=2)
The Registrar

      The Registrar is an office; its holder is responsible for
      keeping track of players.

      The Registrar's weekly report includes:

      1. A list of all players, including information sufficient to
         identify and contact each player.

      2. The date on which each player most recently became a player.

      3. For each forum with non-Foreign publicity, sufficient
         instructions for players to receive messages there.

      The Registrar's monthly report includes:

      1. For each former player for which the information is
         reasonably available, the dates on which e registered and
         deregistered.

      In the first week of every month the Registrar SHALL attempt to
      deregister every player that has not sent a message to a public
      forum in the preceding month.

      The Registrar's duties and abilities also include:

      * Changing the publicity of a forum, as described in Rule 478.

      * Publishing Cantus Cygnei and Writs of FAGE as described in
        Rule 1789.

      The Registrar is also responsible for tracking any switches that
      would otherwise lack an officer to track them, unless the switch
      is defined as untracked.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1789/9 (Power=2)
Cantus Cygneus

      Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously
      by the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part
      of it, e may submit a document to the Registrar, clearly labeled
      a Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and expressing eir
      reproach for those who e feels have treated em so badly.

      In a timely fashion after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the
      Registrar shall publish this document along with a Writ of
      Fugiendae Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione, commanding the
      Player to be deregistered. The Registrar shall note the method
      of deregistration for that Player in subsequent Registrar
      Reports.

      The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and
      the notation in the Registrar's Report will ensure that,
      henceforth, all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of
      FAGE.

======================================================================
Rules & Power
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2141/9 (Power=3)
Role and Attributes of Rules

      A rule is a type of instrument with the capacity to govern the
      game generally, and is always taking effect.  A rule's content
      takes the form of a text, and is unlimited in scope.

      Every rule has power between 0.1 and 4.0 inclusive.  It is
      not possible for a rule to have a power outside this range.

      Rules have ID numbers, to be assigned by the Rulekeepor.

      Every rule shall have a title to aid in identification.  If a
      rule ever does not have a title, the Rulekeepor SHALL assign a
      title to it by announcement in a timely fashion.

      For the purposes of rules governing modification of instruments,
      the text, power, ID number, and title of a rule are all
      substantive aspects of the rule.  However, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the Rulekeepor CAN set rule aspects as
      described elsewhere in this rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1688/8 (Power=3)
Power

      The Power of an entity is a non-negative rational number.  An
      Instrument is an entity with positive Power.

      The Power of an entity cannot be set or modified except as
      stipulated by the Rules.  All entities have Power zero except
      where specifically allowed by the rules.

      Power less than one is called Ephemeral power, and an instrument
      with a power less than one is an Ephemeral instrument.

      A Rule that makes a change, action, or value secured (hereafter
      the securing Rule) thereby makes it IMPOSSIBLE to perform that
      change or action, or to set or modify that value, except as
      allowed by an Instrument with Power greater than or equal to the
      change's Power Threshold.  This Threshold defaults to the
      securing Rule's Power, but CAN be lowered as allowed by that
      Rule (including by the Rule itself).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2140/2 (Power=3)
Power Controls Mutability

      No entity with power below the power of this rule can

      1. cause an entity to have power greater than its own.

      2. adjust the power of an instrument with power greater than
         its own.

      3. set or modify any other substantive aspect of an instrument
         with power greater than its own.  A "substantive" aspect of
         an instrument is any aspect that affects the instrument's
         operation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 217/11 (Power=3)
Interpreting the Rules

      When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
      takes precedence.  Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
      unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense,
      past judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the
      game.

      Definitions and prescriptions in the rules are only to be
      applied using direct, forward reasoning; in particular, an
      absurdity that can be concluded from the assumption that a
      statement about rule-defined concepts is false does not
      constitute proof that it is true.  Definitions in lower-powered
      Rules do not overrule common-sense interpretations or common
      definitions of terms in higher-powered rules.

      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any rule change that
      would (1) prevent a person from initiating a formal process to
      resolve matters of controversy, in the reasonable expectation
      that the controversy will thereby be resolved; or (2) prevent a
      person from causing formal reconsideration of any judicial
      determination that e should be punished, is wholly void and
      without effect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1030/11 (Power=3.2)
Precedence between Rules

      In a conflict between Rules, the conflict shall be resolved by
      performing the following comparisons in the sequence written in
      this rule, until the conflict is resolved.

      - In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule
        with the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the
        lower Power; otherwise,

      - If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
        precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
        determining precedence relations, then the determinations of
        the precedence-determining Rule shall be used to resolve the
        conflicts; otherwise,

      - If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
        itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
        takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then
        such provisions shall be used to resolve the conflict, unless
        they lead to contradictions between each other; otherwise,

      - If any of the rules in conflict have ID numbers, then the Rule
        with the lowest ID number takes precedence; otherwise,

      - The Rule enacted earliest takes precedence.

      Clauses in any other rule that broadly claim precedence (e.g.
      over "all rules" of a certain class) shall be, prima facie,
      considered to be limited claims of precedence or deference that
      are applicable only when such claims are evaluated as described
      within the above sequence.

      No change to the Ruleset can occur that would cause a Rule to
      directly claim precedence over this Rule as a means of
      determining precedence.  This applies to changes by the
      enactment or amendment of a Rule, or of any other form.  This
      Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would permit such a
      change to the Ruleset.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2240/1 (Power=3)
No Cretans Need Apply

      In a conflict between clauses of the same Rule, if exactly one
      claims precedence over the other, then it takes precedence;
      otherwise, the later clause takes precedence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 105/13 (Power=3)
Rule Changes

      Where permitted by other rules, an instrument generally can,
      as part of its effect,

      1. enact a rule.  The new rule has power equal to the minimum
         of the power specified by the enacting instrument,
         defaulting to one if the enacting instrument does not
         specify or if it specifies a power less than 0.1, and the
         maximum power permitted by other rules.  The enacting
         instrument may specify a title for the new rule, which if
         present shall prevail.  The ID number of the new rule cannot
         be specified by the enacting instrument; any attempt to so
         specify is null and void.

      2. repeal a rule.  When a rule is repealed, it ceases to be a
         rule, and the Rulekeepor need no longer maintain a record
         of it.

      3. reenact a rule.  A repealed rule identified by its most
         recent rule number may be reenacted with the same ID number
         and the next change identifier.  If no text is specified,
         the rule is reenacted with the same text it had when it was
         most recently repealed.  If the reenacting proposal provides
         new text for the rule, the rule must have materially the
         same purpose as did the repealed version; otherwise, the
         attempt to reenact the rule is null and void.

      4. amend the text of a rule.

      5. retitle a rule.

      6. change the power of a rule.

      A rule change is any effect that falls into the above classes.
      Rule changes always occur sequentially, never simultaneously.

      Any ambiguity in the specification of a rule change causes that
      change to be void and without effect.  An inconsequential
      variation in the quotation of an existing rule does not
      constitute ambiguity for the purposes of this rule, but any
      other variation does.

      A rule change is wholly prevented from taking effect unless its
      full text was published, along with an unambiguous and clear
      specification of the method to be used for changing the rule, at
      least 4 days and no more than 60 days before it would otherwise
      take effect.

      This rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be
      created, modified, or destroyed, or by which an entity can
      become a rule or cease to be a rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

======================================================================
Reusable Definitions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2152/7 (Power=3)
Mother, May I?

      The following terms are defined.  These definitions are used
      when a rule includes a term in all caps, and provide guidance in
      determining the ordinary-language meaning of a term when a rule
      includes a term otherwise.  Earlier definitions take precedence
      over later ones.  If a rule specifies one or more persons in
      connection with a term, then the term applies only to the
      specified person(s).

      1. CANNOT, IMPOSSIBLE, INEFFECTIVE, INVALID:  Attempts to
         perform the described action are unsuccessful.

      2. MUST NOT, MAY NOT, SHALL NOT, ILLEGAL, PROHIBITED: Performing
         the described action violates the rule in question.

      3. NEED NOT, OPTIONAL:  Failing to perform the described action
         does not violate the rules.

      4. SHOULD NOT, DISCOURAGED, DEPRECATED:  Before performing the
         described action, the full implications of performing it
         should be understood and carefully weighed.

      5. CAN: Attempts to perform the described action are successful.

      6. MAY: Performing the described action does not violate the
         rules.

      7. MUST, SHALL, REQUIRED, MANDATORY:  Failing to perform the
         described action violates the rule in question.

      8. SHOULD, ENCOURAGED, RECOMMENDED:  Before failing to perform
         the described action, the full implications of failing to
         perform it should (in the ordinary-language sense) be
         understood and carefully weighed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2162/8 (Power=2)
Switches

      A type of switch is a property that the rules define as a
      switch, and specify the following:

      1. The type(s) of entity possessing an instance of that switch.
         No other entity possesses an instance of that switch.

      2. One or more possible values for instances of that switch,
         exactly one of which is designated as the default.  No other
         values are possible for instances of that switch.

      3. Optionally, exactly one office whose holder tracks instances
         of that switch.  That officer's (weekly, if not specified
         otherwise) report includes the value of each instance of that
         switch whose value is not its default value; a public
         document purporting to be this portion of that officer's
         report is self-ratifying, and implies that other instances
         are at their default value.

      At any given time, each instance of a switch has exactly one
      possible value for that type of switch.  If an instance of a
      switch comes to have a value, it ceases to have any other value.
      If an instance of a switch would otherwise fail to have a
      possible value, it comes to have its default value.

      "To flip an instance of a switch" is to make it come to have a
      given value.  "To become X" (where X is a possible value of
      exactly one of the subject's switches) is to flip that switch to
      X.

      If an action or set of actions would cause the value of an
      instance of a switch to become indeterminate, the instance
      instead takes on its last determinate and possible value, if
      any, otherwise it takes on its default value.

      A natural switch is a switch with a default value of 0, unless
      the rules explicitly specify a different default value.  If the
      rules define an upper limit for the switch, then the possible
      values are non-negative integers not greater than that limit,
      otherwise the values are the non-negative integers.

      A singleton switch is a switch for which Agora Nomic is the only
      entity possessing an instance of that switch.

      A boolean switch is a switch with values True and False. A
      positive boolean switch has a default of True; a negative
      boolean switch has a default of False.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2125/9 (Power=3)
Regulated Actions

      An action is restricted if: (1) the Rules limit, allow, enable,
      or permit its performance; (2) describe the circumstances under
      which the action would succeed or fail; or (3) the action would,
      as part of its effect, modify information for which some player
      is required to be a recordkeepor.

      Restricted Actions CAN only be performed as described by the
      Rules.  The Rules SHALL NOT be interpreted so as to proscribe
      unrestricted actions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1023/36 (Power=2)
Common Definitions

      The following terms are defined:

      1. The phrase "in a timely fashion" means "within 7 days".
         This time period is set when the requirement is created
         (i.e. X days before the limit ends).  A requirement to
         perform an action at an exact instant (e.g.  "when X, Y
         SHALL Z"), but not "in the same message", is instead
         interpreted as a requirement to perform that action in a
         timely fashion after that instant.

      2. Agoran epochs:

          1. Agoran days begin at midnight UTC.

          2. Agoran weeks begin at midnight UTC on Monday.

          3. Agoran months begin at midnight UTC on the first day of
             each Gregorian month.

          4. Agoran quarters begin when the Agoran months of January,
             April, July, and October begin.

          5. Agoran years begin when the Agoran month of January
             begins.

          6. A pivot is either the instant at which Agora Nomic began
             (June 30, 1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200) or an instant at
             which at least one person won the game.  When used as a
             period of time, a "Round" (historical syn: "game") is
             the period of time between a pivot and the next pivot.

          These definitions do not apply to relative durations (e.g.
          "within <number> days after <event>").

      3. If a restricted value, or the value of a conditional, or a
         value otherwise required to determine the outcome of a
         restricted action, CANNOT be reasonably determined (without
         circularity or paradox) from information reasonably
         available, or if it alternates instantaneously and
         indefinitely between values, then the value is considered to
         be Indeterminate, otherwise it is Determinate.

      4. Two points in time are within a month of each other if:

          1. they occur in the same Agoran month;

          2. they occur in two consecutive Agoran months, and the
             later of the two occurs in an earlier day in the month
             than the earlier one;

          3. they occur in two consecutive Agoran months on the same
             day of the month, and the later of the two occurs at the
             same or earlier time of day.

Rule 1728/36 (Power=3)
Dependent Actions

      A rule which purports to allow a person (the performer) to
      perform an action by a set of one or more of the following
      methods (N is 1 unless otherwise specified):

       1. Without N Objections, where N is a positive integer no
          greater than 8.  ("Without Objection" is shorthand for this
          method with N = 1.)
       2. With N Supporters, where N is a positive integer.  ("With
          Support" is shorthand for this method with N = 1.)
       3. With N Agoran Consent, where N is an integer multiple of 0.1
          with a minimum of 1.
       4. With Notice.
       5. With T Notice, where T is a time period.

      thereby allows em to perform the action by announcement if all
      of the following are true:

       1. A person (the initiator) announced intent to perform the
          action, unambiguously and clearly specifying the action and
          method(s) (including the value of N and/or T for each
          method), at most fourteen days earlier.

       2. If the action is to be performed With N Objections, With N
          Agoran Consent, or With Notice, if the intent was announced
          at least 4 days earlier.

       3. If the action is to be performed With T Notice, if the
          intent was announced at least T earlier.

       4. At least one of the following is true:

            1. The performer is the initiator.

            2. The initiator was authorized to perform the action due
               to holding a rule-defined position now held by the
               performer.

            3. The initiator is authorized to perform the action, the
               action depends on support, the performer has supported
               the intent, and the rule authorizing the performance
               does not explicitly prohibit supporters from performing
               it.

       5. Agora is Satisfied with the announced intent, as defined by
          other rules.

       6. If a set of conditions for the performance of the action was
          given in the announcement of intent to perform the action,
          all those conditions are met.

      The actor SHOULD publish a list of supporters if the action
      depends on support, and a list of objectors if it depends on
      objections.

          IT IS HEREBY PROCLAIMED that a Royal Parade be established,
                imbued in this very Rule,
                which shall travel around Agora to Rules of import;
          AND THEREFORE, the Rulekeepor SHOULD place this Rule
                near recently-amended rules of high Power;
          AND FURTHERMORE, additions to this Parade are most welcome
               when Events suiting the honour should occur.

Rule 2124/20 (Power=2)
Agoran Satisfaction


      A Supporter of a dependent action is an eligible entity who has publicly
      posted (and not withdrawn) support (syn. "consent") for an announcement of
      intent to perform the action.An Objector to a dependent action is an
      eligible entity who has publicly posted (and not withdrawn) an objection
      to the announcement of intent to perform the action.

      The entities eligible to support or object to a dependent action are, by
      default, all players, subject to modification by the document authorizing
      the dependent action.However, the previous sentence notwithstanding, the
      Executor of the announcement of intent is not eligible to support it.

      Agora is Satisfied with an intent to perform a specific action if and only
      if:

      1. if the action is to be performed Without N Objections, then it has
         fewer than N objectors;

      2. if the action is to be performed With N supporters, then it has N or
         more supporters; and

      3. if the action is to be performed with N Agoran Consent, then the ratio
         of supporters to objectors is greater than N, or the action has at
         least one supporter and no objectors.

      4. if the action is to be performed With Notice or With T Notice.

      The above notwithstanding, if the action depends on objections, and an
      objection to it has been withdrawn within the past 24 hours, then Agora is
      not Satisfied with the intent.

      The above notwithstanding, Agora is not satisfied with the intent if the
      Speaker has objected to it in the last 48 hours.

      A person CANNOT support or object to an announcement of intent before the
      intent is announced, or after e has withdrawn the same type of response.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2466/0 (Power=3)
Acting on Behalf

      When a rule allows one person (the agent) to act on behalf of another (the
      principal) to perform an action, that agent CAN perform the action if it
      is POSSIBLE for the principal to do so, taking into account any
      prerequisites for the action. If the enabling rule does not specify the
      mechanism by which the agent may do so, then the agent CAN perform the
      action in the same manner in which the principal CAN do so, with the
      additional requirement that the agent must, in the message in which the
      action is performed, uniquely identify the principal and that the action
      is being taken on behalf of that person.

      When an action is performed on behalf of a principal, then the action is
      considered for all game purposes to have been performed by the principal.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule which would prohibit a person
      from taking an action, except that it defers to any rule that imposes
      limitations specifically on actions taken on behalf of another person.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2166/22 (Power=3)
Assets

      An asset is an entity defined as such by the ruleset (hereafter its backing
      document), and existing solely because its backing document defines its
      existence.

      Each asset has exactly one owner.If an asset would otherwise lack an
      owner, it is owned by Agora.If an asset's backing document restricts
      its ownership to a class of entities, then that asset CANNOT be
      gained by or transferred to an entity outside that class, and is
      destroyed if it is owned by an entity outside that class (except for
      Agora, in which case any player CAN transfer or destroy it without
      objection). The restrictions in the previous sentence are subject to
      modification by its backing document.

      Unless modified by an asset's backing document, ownership of an asset is
      restricted to Agora, persons, and organizations.

      An organization's charter CAN specify whether or not that organization is
      willing receive assets or a class of assets. Generally, an organization CANNOT
      be given assets its charter states that it is unwilling to receive. The
      previous provisions of this paragraph do not apply to an asset if the
      organization is required to provide that asset in order to continue existing.

      The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity (if any)
      defined as such by, and bound by, its backing document.  That
      entity's report includes a list of all instances of that class
      and their owners.  This portion of that entity's report is
      self-ratifying.

      An asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner by
      announcement, subject to modification by its backing document. An
      indestructible asset is one defined as such by it backing document, and CANNOT
      be destroyed except by a rule specifically addressing the destruction of
      indestructible assets or that asset in particular; any other asset is
      destructible. In circumstances where another asset would be
      destroyed, an indestructible asset is generally transferred to Agora, subject
      to modification by its backing document and the intervention of other rules.

      To "lose" an asset is to have it destroyed from one's
      possession; to "revoke" an asset from an entity is to destroy it
      from that entity's possession.

      An asset generally CAN be transferred (syn. payed, given) by its owner to
      another entity by announcement, subject to modification by its backing
      document.  A fixed asset is one defined as such by its backing
      document, and CANNOT be transferred; any other asset is liquid.

      When a rule indicates transfering an amount that is not a natural number,
      the specified amount is rounded up to the nearest natural number.

      A currency is a class of asset defined as such by its backing document.
      Instances of a currency with the same owner are fungible.

      The "x balance of an entity", where x is a currency, is the number of x that
      entity possesses. If a rule, proposal, or other competent authority attempts
      to increase or decrease the balance of an entity without specifying a source
      or destination, then the currency is created or destroyed.

      When a player causes one or more balances to change, e is ENCOURAGED
      to specify the resulting balance(s). Players SHOULD NOT specify
      inaccurate balances.

      Where it resolves ambiguity, the asset or currency being referred to is the
      currency designated as "Agora's official currency", if there is one.

      Amendments to a backing document shall not be construed to alter, transfer,
      destroy, or otherwise effect any assets defined by that document, unless
      that is their clear intent.

      Assets are always public. [To provide for private contract based assets later]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2493/0 (Power=3.1)
Regulations

      A Regulation is an instrument defined as such by this rule. A regulation
      allows an officer (known as the Promulgator) to exercise rule defined powers.
      A regulation is in effect continuously from the time of its creation to the
      time of either its revocation or the repeal of the rule that allowed for its
      creation. When recommending a regulation, its Promulgator must specify by
      number the rule(s) upon which it is based (the parent rules), the list of
      which becomes an integral part of the regulation. The list of rules can
      generally be modified by the Promulgator according to the procedure for text
      changes.

      A regulation must be authorized by at least one rule in order for it to exist.
      A regulation has effect on the game (only) insofar as the rule or rules that
      authorized it permit it to have effect, and a regulation generally inherits
      the power of its least powerful parent rule, unless its Promulgator defines
      a lower power. If reasonably possible, a regulation should be
      interpreted so as to defer to other rules. The procedure for resolving
      conflict between regulations is the same as it is for rules.

      Regulations are generally issued according to the following procedures,
      and they can be repealed by the announcement of their Promulgator. Alternate
      procedures may be used if provided for by all of the regulations's parent
      rules. If one parent rule specifies procedures that are more stringent than
      those that the other(s) specifies, those apply. Creating, modifying, revoking,
      or allowing for a regulation is secured at power 1.

      A regulation (or set of regulations), authorized by another rule, may
      generally be enacted or modified by its promulgator without 2 objections,
      or with Agoran consent. A notice pursuant to the previous sentence is
      known as a "recommendation", and the regulation(s) are said to be
      "recommended" to Agora.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2494/0 (Power=1)
The Regkeepor

      The Regkeepor is an office, responsible for the maintenance of the
      Regulations. The Regulations are contained in the Regkeepor's weekly report,
      know as the Agora Nomic Code of Regulations (ACORN). E MAY publish multiple
      versions or editions of the ACORN.

      The ACORN is divided into titles, assigned by the Regkeepor, which are
      each given an integer.  Generally, each office with the power to create
      regulations SHOULD be assigned the next successive natural number. Title 0 of
      the ACORN is reserved for use by the Regkeepor, and nothing in that title
      need be a regulation. Non-regulations printed in the ACORN
      have no binding effect, and SHALL clearly be marked by the Regkeepor.

      Each regulation SHALL be assigned an ID number by the Regkeepor, consisting
      of a string of the characters [0-9] and separator characters. The Regkeepor
      SHOULD establish some way of keeping track of the version of a regulations.
      The Regkeepor MAY also, at eir discretion, create ways of marking special
      types of Regulation (even in violation of the previous restrictions of this
      paragraph), mark sections or titles as reserved for future use, and
      make such other discussions of arrangement, annotation, and marking as are
      necessary and proper in the execution of eir duties.

      The Regkeepor SHOULD remember that the purpose of the ACORN is to make the
      regulations easily readable, and e SHALL not act in a manner intended to
      deceive others in eir official capacity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2500/0 (Power=1)
Action Points

      At the beginning of every Agoran Week, every player has 2 Action Points.
      When a player 'spends' an Action Point, e has one less Action Point. If a
      player has 0 Action Points, e may not spend any more Action Points, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

======================================================================
Proposals
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2350/9 (Power=3)
Proposals

      A proposal is a type of entity consisting of a body of text and
      other attributes.  A player CAN create a proposal by
      announcement, specifying its text and optionally specifying any
      of the following attributes:

      * An associated title.
      * A list of co-authors (which must be persons other than the
        author).
      * An adoption index.

      Creating a proposal adds it to the Proposal Pool.  Once a
      proposal is created, nether its text nor any of the
      aforementioned attributes can be changed.  The author (syn.
      proposer) of a proposal is the person who submitted it.

      If a decision of whether to adopt a proposal was resolved as
      FAILED QUORUM in the last seven days, the Promotor CAN once add
      the proposal back to the Proposal Pool by announcement.

      The author of a proposal in the Proposal Pool CAN remove (syn.
      retract, withdraw) it from the Pool by announcement.

      The Promotor CAN remove a proposal from the Proposal Pool by
      announcement if it is not pending and has been added to the Pool
      more than 14 days ago.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2445/8 (Power=1)
How to Pend a Proposal

      Imminence is a switch, tracked by the Promotor, possessed by
      proposals in the Proposal Pool, whose value is either "pending" or
      "not pending" (default).

      Any player CAN flip a specified proposal's imminence to "pending" by
      announcement by:

        a) spending 1 Action Point, OR

        b) spending 1/20th the Floating Value in shinies.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1607/43 (Power=3)
Distribution

      The Promotor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      receiving and distributing proposals.

      Determining whether to adopt a proposal is an Agoran decision.
      For this decision, the vote collector is the Assessor, the
      adoption index is initially the adoption index of the proposal,
      or 1.0 if the proposal does not have one, and the text, author,
      and coauthors of the proposal are essential parameters. 
      Initiating such a decision is known as distribution, and removes
      the proposal from the Proposal Pool.

      The Promotor CAN distribute a proposal which is in the Proposal
      Pool at any time. The Promotor SHALL NOT distribute proposals
      which are not pending.

      In a given Agoran week, the Promotor SHALL, as part of eir
      weekly duties, distribute all pending proposals.

      Distributed proposals have ID numbers, to be assigned by the
      Promotor.

      If there is a Proposal in the Pool that it would otherwise be
      IMPOSSIBLE for any player to distribute, then any player CAN
      distribute that Proposal Without 3 Objections.

      The Promotor's report includes a list of all proposals in the
      Proposal Pool, along with their text and attributes.  This
      portion of a public document purporting to be a Promotor's
      report is self-ratifying.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2137/2 (Power=1)
The Assessor

      The Assessor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      collecting votes and keeping track of related properties.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 106/36 (Power=3)
Adopting Proposals

      When a decision about whether to adopt a proposal is resolved, if the
      outcome is ADOPTED, then the proposal in question is adopted, and unless
      other rules prevent it from taking effect, its power is set to the minimum
      of four and its adoption index, and then it takes effect.Except as
      prohibited by other rules, a proposal that takes effect CAN and does, as
      part of its effect, apply the changes that it specifies.If the proposal
      cannot make some such changes, this does not preclude the other changes
      from taking place.

      If there is no Agoran Decision to adopt a particular proposal that has an
      outcome of ADOPTED, that proposal CANNOT take effect, rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

      Preventing a proposal from taking effect is a secured change; this does
      not apply to generally preventing changes to specified areas of the
      gamestate, nor to a proposal preventing itself from taking effect (its no-
      effect clause is generally interpreted as applying only to the rest of the
      proposal).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2443/1 (Power=3)
Expediting Proposals

      A player CAN expedite a proposal whose adoption index is at most
      1.5, in a message containing the character string "[Expedition]"
      in the subject line,

        1. by specially deputising for the Promotor to distribute the
           proposal, if it has not been distributed; or
        2. by announcement, otherwise.

      If, in an Agoran Decision to adopt a proposal, the strength of
      AGAINST is zero, and the proposal was expedited at least 7 days
      earlier, then any player CAN specially deputise for the Assessor
      to resolve the decision.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2431/1 (Power=1)
Proposal Competitions

      Any player CAN, with Agoran Consent, initiate a Proposal
      Competition with a specified Objective. Only one Competition may
      be in progress at a time. The Objective should be a
      specification of effects of a proposal, and SHOULD NOT depend on
      factors that could not be determined from the text of a
      proposal.

      During the Agoran Week following the initiation of a Proposal
      Competition, any player CAN specify that a Proposal e submits is
      a Competition Proposal for that Competition.  Players are
      ENCOURAGED to describe how their Competition Proposals fulfill
      the Objective.

      The Promotor SHALL distribute all Competition Proposals for a
      given Competition in the same message. The Assessor SHALL
      resolve all the Agoran Decisions to adopt the Competition
      Proposals for a given Competition in the same message.

      Once all Agoran decisions to adopt Competition Proposals for a
      given Competition have been resolved, the Competition ends.

Voting & Elections
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 693/16 (Power=3)
Agoran Decisions

      When the rules calls for an Agoran decision to be made, the decision-
      making process takes place in the following three stages, each described
      elsewhere:

        1. Initiation of the decision.
        2. Voting of the people.
        3. Resolution of the decision.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 107/19 (Power=3)
Initiating Agoran Decisions

      An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
      initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
      to initiate the decision.  This notice is invalid if it lacks
      any of the following information, and the lack is correctly
      identified within one week after the notice is published:

      1. The matter to be decided (for example, "the adoption of
         proposal 4781").

      2. A clear indication of the set of valid votes.

      3. The identity of the vote collector.

      4. Any additional information defined by the rules as essential
         parameters.

      The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting
      period for the decision.  The voting period lasts for 7 days.
      The minimum voting period for a decision with at least two
      options is five days.  The vote collector for a decision with
      less than two options CAN and SHALL end the voting period by
      announcement, if it has not ended already, and provided that e
      resolves the decision in the same message.

      The voting period for a decision cannot be set or changed to a
      duration longer than fourteen days.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 683/25 (Power=3)
Voting on Agoran Decisions

      An entity submits a ballot on an Agoran decision by publishing a
      notice satisfying the following conditions:

      1. The ballot is submitted during the voting period for the
         decision.

      2. The entity casting the ballot (the voter) was, at the
         initiation of the decision, a player.

      3. The ballot clearly identifies the matter to be decided.

      4. The ballot clearly identifies a valid vote, as determined by
         the voting method.

      5. The ballot clearly sets forth the voter's intent to place
         the identified vote.

      6. The voter has no other valid ballots on the same decision.

      A valid ballot is a ballot, correctly submitted, that has not
      been withdrawn. During the voting period of an Agoran decision,
      a player CAN by announcement withdraw (syn. retract) a ballot
      that e submitted on that decision. To "change" one's vote is to
      retract eir previous ballot (if any), then submit a new one.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 208/12 (Power=3)
Resolving Agoran Decisions

      The vote collector for an unresolved Agoran decision CAN resolve
      it by announcement, indicating the outcome.  If it was required
      to be initiated, then e SHALL resolve it in a timely fashion
      after the end of the voting period.  To be valid, this
      announcement must satisfy the following conditions:

      1. It is published after the voting period has ended.

      2. It clearly identifies the matter to be resolved.

      3. It specifies the outcome, as described elsewhere, and, if
         there was more than one valid option, provides a tally of
         the voters' valid ballots.

      Each Agoran decision has exactly one vote collector, defaulting
      to the initiator of the decision.  If the vote collector is
      defined by reference to a position (or, in the default case, if
      the initiator was so defined), then the vote collector is the
      current holder of that position.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule that would provide
      another mechanism by which an Agoran decision may be resolved.

      In general, changes to the gamestate due to the outcome of an
      Agoran decision take effect when the decision is resolved.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 955/22 (Power=3)
Determining the Will of Agora

      Each Agoran decision has a voting method, which determines how
      voters may vote on it and how to calculate the outcome. The
      strength of a ballot is the voting strength of the voter who
      cast it on that Agoran decision.

      The following voting methods are defined:

      1. AI-majority: the valid votes are FOR and AGAINST. Let F be
         the total strength of all valid ballots cast FOR a decision,
         A be the same for AGAINST, and AI be the adoption index of
         the decision. The outcome is ADOPTED if F/A >= AI and F/A >
         1 (or F>0 and A=0), otherwise REJECTED.

      2. Instant runoff: the valid votes are ordered lists of
         options, and the outcome is whichever option wins according
         to the standard definition of instant runoff. For this
         purpose, a ballot of strength N is treated as if it were N
         distinct ballots expressing the same preferences. In case
         multiple valid options tie for the lowest number of votes at
         any stage, the vote collector CAN and must, in the
         announcement of the decision's resolution, select one such
         option to eliminate; if, for M > 1, all eir possible choices
         in the next M stages would result in the same set of options
         being eliminated, e need not specify the order of
         elimination.

      3. First-past-the-post (default): the valid votes are the
         options, and the outcome is whichever option received the
         highest total strength of valid ballots. In case of a tie,
         the vote collector CAN and must, in the announcement of the
         decision's resolution, select one of the leaders as the
         outcome.

      The previous notwithstanding:

      - If there is more than one option, and the number of valid
        ballots is less than the quorum of that decision, the outcome
        is instead FAILED QUORUM.
      - PRESENT is always a valid vote, with no effect on the outcome
        except counting towards quorum.
      - If there are no valid options, the outcome is null.

      The outcome of a decision is determined when it is resolved, and
      cannot change thereafter.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 879/33 (Power=2)
Quorum

      Each Agoran Decision has a quorum. This is a number set when the
      decision is created, and thereafter cannot be changed. When a
      person initiates an Agoran Decision, that person SHALL state the
      quorum of that decision. However, incorrectly stating the quorum
      of a decision does not invalidate the initiation, nor does it
      actually change the quorum of the decision.

      The quorum that an Agoran Decision gains as it is created can be
      defined by other rules of power 2 or greater. If no other rule
      defines the quorum of an Agoran Decision, the quorum for that
      decision is equal to the number of players who voted on the
      Agoran Decision to adopt a proposal that had been most recently
      resolved at the time of that decision's initiation, minus 2.

      As an exception to the previous paragraph, the quorum of an
      Agoran Decision can never be less than 2. If the rules would
      attempt to set the quorum of an Agoran Decision to less than 2,
      it is set to 2 instead.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2422/2 (Power=3)
Voting Strength

      The voting strength of an entity on an Agoran decision is an
      integer between 0 and 5 inclusive, defined by rules of power 2
      or greater. If not otherwise specified, the voting strength of
      an entity on an Agoran decision is 1.

      When multiple rules set or modify an entity's voting strength on
      an Agoran decision, it shall be determined by first applying the
      rule(s) which set it to a specific value, using the ordinary
      precedence of rules, and then applying the rules, other than
      this one, which modify it, in numerical order by ID. Finally, if
      theresult of the calculation is not an integer, it is rounded
      up, and then if it is outside the allowable range of values for
      voting strength, it is set to the the minimum value if it was
      less and the maximum value if it was more.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2127/9 (Power=3)
Conditional Votes

      If a vote on an Agoran decision is submitted conditionally (e.g.
      "FOR if <X> is true, otherwise AGAINST"), then the selected
      option is evaluated based on the value of the condition(s) at
      the end of the voting period, and, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, is clearly specified if and only if the value
      of the condition(s) is/are determinate at the end of the voting
      period.  If the option cannot be clearly identified, a vote of
      PRESENT is cast.

      Casting a vote endorsing another voter is equivalent to
      conditionally casting a vote whose value is the same as the most
      common value (if any) among that voter's valid votes on that
      decision.

      Casting a vote denouncing another voter is equivalent to
      conditionally casting a vote whose value is opposite to the most
      common value (if any) among that voter's valid votes on that
      decision.  FOR and AGAINST are opposites.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2168/7 (Power=1)
Extending the voting period

      Whenever the voting period of an Agoran decision would end, and
      the result would be FAILED QUORUM, the length of the voting
      period for that decision is instead increased to 14 days, except
      if it is already that length, provided this has not already
      happened for the decision in question.

      Upon such an occurrence, the vote collector for the decision
      SHALL issue a humiliating public reminder to the slackers who
      have not yet cast any votes on it despite being eligible, and
      CAN end its voting period by announcement (resolving it
      constitutes an implicit announcement that its voting period is
      first ended) if the result would no longer be FAILED QUORUM, or
      if the decision is whether to adopt a proposal and no voter
      (other than possibly the proposal's author) has voted FOR.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1950/32 (Power=3)
Decisions with Adoption Indices

      Adoption index is an untracked switch possessed by Agoran
      decisions and proposals, whose value is either "none" (default)
      or an integral multiple of 0.1 from 1.0 to 9.9.

      Adoption index is secured with a power threshold of 2.

      Adoption index is an essential parameter of an Agoran decision
      if that decision has an adoption index.

      For any Agoran decision with an adoption index, the voting
      method is AI-majority.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2034/9 (Power=3)
Vote Protection and Cutoff for Challenges

      A public message purporting to resolve an Agoran decision
      constitutes self-ratifying claims that

       1. such a decision existed,
       2. it was resolved as indicated, and
       3. (if the indicated outcome was to adopt a proposal) such a
          proposal existed, was adopted, and took effect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2154/50 (Power=2)
Election Procedure

      A player CAN initiate an election for a specified elected office
      for which no election is already in progress

      1. by announcement, if e is the ADoP, if the office has been
         deputised for within the past two weeks, or if no election
         has been initiated for the office either since the last time
         a player won the game or within the past 90 days;

      2. with 4 Supporters, otherwise.

      After the election is initiated, any player CAN once initiate an
      Agoran decision to determine the new officeholder, and the ADoP
      SHALL do so in a timely fashion if no one else does first.  For
      this decision, the valid options are the players, the vote
      collector is the ADoP, and the voting method is instant runoff.
      Upon the resolution of this decision, its outcome, if a player,
      is installed into office, and the election ends.

Offices & Reporting
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1006/38 (Power=2)
Offices

      Officeholder is an office switch tracked by the ADoP, with
      possible values of any person or "vacant".  An officer is the
      holder of an office, who may be referred to by the name of that
      office.  If the holder of an office is ever not a player, it
      becomes vacant.

      An imposed office is an office described as such by the rule
      defining it.  All others are elected.  A person CANNOT be made
      the holder of an elected office without eir explicit or
      reasonably implied consent.

      The holder of an elected office CAN resign it by announcement,
      causing it to become vacant. Any player CAN cause an office to
      become vacant without 2 objections.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2143/26 (Power=1)
Official Reports and Duties

      For each person:

      1. If any task is defined by the rules as part of that person's
         weekly duties, then e SHALL perform it at least once each
         week.  If any information is defined by the rules as part of
         that person's weekly report, then e SHALL maintain all such
         information, and the publication of all such information is
         part of eir weekly duties.

      2. If any task is defined by the rules as part of that person's
         monthly duties, then e SHALL perform it at least once each
         month.  If any information is defined by the rules as part of
         that person's monthly report, then e SHALL maintain all such
         information, and the publication of all such information is
         part of eir monthly duties.

      Any information defined by the rules as part of a person's
      report, without specifying which one, is part of eir weekly
      report.  Failure of a person to perform any duty required of em
      within the allotted time is the Class-2 crime of Tardiness.

      An official duty for an office is any duty that the Rules
      specifically assign to that office's holder in particular
      (regardless of eir identity).

      A person SHALL NOT publish information that is inaccurate or
      misleading while performing an official duty, or within a
      document purporting to be part of any person or office's weekly
      or monthly report.

      Reports SHALL be published in plain text.  Tabular data must
      line up properly when viewed in a monospaced font.  Publishing a
      report that deviates from these restrictions is the Class 2 Crime
      of Making My Eyes Bleed.

      Officers SHOULD maintain a publicly visible copy of their
      reports on the World Wide Web, and they SHOULD publish the
      address of this copy along with their published reports.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2138/23 (Power=1)
The Associate Director of Personnel

      The Associate Director of Personnel (ADoP) is an office; its
      holder is responsible for keeping track of officers.

      The ADoP's report includes the following:

      1. The date of the last change (if any) to each office's
         Officeholder.
      2. The date on which the most recent election for each office
         was initiated.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1551/18 (Power=3.1)
Ratification

      A public document is part (possibly all) of a public message.

      When a public document is ratified, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the gamestate is modified to what it would be
      if, at the time the ratified document was published, the
      gamestate had been minimally modified to make the ratified
      document as true and accurate as possible.  Such a modification
      cannot add inconsistencies between the gamestate and the rules,
      and it cannot include rule changes unless the ratified document
      explicitly and unambiguously recites either the changes or the
      resulting properties of the rule(s).  If no such modification is
      possible, or multiple substantially distinct possible
      modifications would be equally appropriate, the ratification
      fails.

      An internally inconsistent document generally cannot be
      ratified; however, if such a document can be divided into a
      summary section and a main section, where the only purpose of
      the summary section is to summarize information in the main
      section, and the main section is internally consistent,
      ratification of the document proceeds as if it contained only
      the main section.

      Text purportedly about previous instances of ratification (e.g.
      a report's date of last ratification) is excluded from
      ratification. The rules may define additional information that
      is considered to be part of the document for the purposes of
      ratification; such definitions are secured at a Power
      Threshold of 3.

      Ratifying a public document is secured with power threshold 3.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2202/6 (Power=3)
Ratification Without Objection

      Any player CAN, without objection, ratify a public document,
      specifying its scope.

      Ratification Without Objection CANNOT cause the repeal,
      amendment, enactment, or mutation of any Rule, rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

      A player SHALL NOT knowingly use or announce intent to use
      Ratification Without Objection to ratify a (prior to
      ratification) document containing incorrect or Indeterminate
      information when a corrected document could be produced with
      reasonable effort, unless the general nature of the document's
      error and reason for ratifying it is clearly and plainly
      described in the announcement of intent.  Such ratification
      or announcement of intent to ratify is the Class-8 Crime of
      Endorsing Forgery.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2201/7 (Power=3)
Self-Ratification

      A public document defined by the rules as self-ratifying is
      ratified when it is continuously undoubted for one week.

      A doubt is an explicit public challenge via one of the following
      methods, identifying a document and explaining the scope and
      nature of a perceived error in it:

       1. An inquiry case, appropriate for questions of legal
          interpretation.

       2. A claim of error, appropriate for matters of fact.  The
          publisher of the original document SHALL (if e was required
          to publish that document) or SHOULD (otherwise) do one of
          the following in a timely fashion:

            1. Deny the claim (causing it to cease to be a doubt).
            2. Publish a revision.
            3. Initiate an inquiry case regarding the truth of the
               claim (if the subject is actually a matter of law),
               or cite a relevant existing inquiry case.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2160/15 (Power=3)
Deputisation

      A rule which purports to allow a person (a deputy) to perform an
      action via normal deputisation or special deputisation for an
      office thereby allows them to perform the action as if e held
      the office, as long as

        1. it would be POSSIBLE for the deputy to perform the action,
           other than by deputisation, if e held the office, and

        2. the deputy, when performing the action, announces that e
           is doing so by the appropriate form of deputisation.

      Only this rule may allow normal deputisation. Any rule may allow
      special deputisation.

      A player CAN perform an action as if e held a particular office,
      via normal deputisation, if all of the following are true:

        1. The rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of
           holding that office, to perform the action. This
           requirement is fulfilled by the deputy performing the
           action.

        2. A time limit by which the rules require the action to be
           performed has expired.

        3. Either (i) the office is vacant; or (ii) the
           aforementioned time limit expired more than fourteen days
           ago; or (iii) the deputy announced between two and
           fourteen days earlier that e intended to deputise for that
           office for the purposes of the particular action.

      When a player deputises via normal deputisation for an elected
      office, e becomes the holder of that office.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2472/1 (Power=2)
Office Incompatibilities

      Some pairs of office are incompatible:

      1. Prime Minister and Speaker
      2. Promotor and Assessor
      3. Promotor and ADoP
      4. Referee and Arbitor

      A player is Overpowered if e holds two offices which are
      incompatible with each other. Rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, a player CANNOT be installed into an office if
      doing so would make em Overpowered.

      If a player is Overpowered, any player CAN Demand Resignation
      from em by announcement, provided e has announced intent do to
      so between four and fourteen days earlier. The Overpowered
      player is then removed from all offices.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2379/0 (Power=1)
No News Is Some News

      If the rules define a report as including a list, then while

======================================================================
Rulekeeping
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1051/18 (Power=1)
The Rulekeepor

      The Rulekeepor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      maintaining the text of the rules of Agora.

      The Rulekeepor's Weekly report includes the Short Logical
      Ruleset.  The Rulekeepor's Monthly report includes the Full
      Logical Ruleset.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1681/21 (Power=1)
The Logical Rulesets

      The Short Logical Ruleset (SLR) is a format of the ruleset.  In
      this format, each rule is assigned to a category, and the rules
      are grouped according to their category.

      Rules are assigned to, ordered within, or moved between
      categories, and categories are added, changed, or empty
      categories removed, as the Rulekeepor sees fit.

      The listing of each rule in the SLR must include the rule's ID
      number, revision number, power, title, and text.

      The Rulekeepor is strongly DISCOURAGED from including any
      additional information in the SLR, except that which increases
      the readability of the SLR.

      The Full Logical Ruleset (FLR) is a format of the ruleset.  In
      this format, rules are assigned to the same category and
      presented in the same order as in the SLR.  The FLR must contain
      all the information required to be in the SLR, and any
      historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is required to
      record.

      The Rulekeepor SHOULD also include any other information which e
      feels may be helpful in the use of the ruleset in the FLR.

      Whenever a rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeepor SHALL
      record a historical annotation to the rule indicating:

      1. The type of change.

      2. The date on which the change took effect.

      3. The mechanism that specified the change.

      4. If the rule was changed due to a proposal, then that
         proposal's ID number, author, and co-author(s) (if any).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2430/2 (Power=3)
Cleanup Time

      The Rulekeepor CAN, without objection, cause this rule to amend
      any specified rule by:

        1. Changing the capitalization of a word, except to or from
           all caps.
        2. Changing visual formatting (such as the layout and
           bulleting of a list).
        3. Correcting formatting inconsistencies (such as doubled or
           skipped items in a list).

      Such a change SHALL NOT be made if it would plausibly affect the
      interpretation of a rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2429/1 (Power=1)
Bleach

      Replacing a non-zero amount of whitespace with a different
      non-zero amount of whitespace is generally insignificant, except
      for paragraph breaks.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

======================================================================
Calls for Judgement
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 991/17 (Power=2)
Calls for Judgement

      Any person (the initiator) can initiate a Call for Judgement (CFJ,
      syn. Judicial Case), specifying a statement to be inquired into:

        a) by announcement, and spending 1 Action Point, OR

        b) by announcement, and spending 1/20th the Floating Value in
        shinies, OR

        c) by announcement if e is not a player.

      When a person initiates a Call for Judgment, e may optionally bar one
      person from the case.

      At any time, each CFJ is either open (default), suspended, or
      assigned exactly one judgement.

      The Arbitor is an office, responsible for the administration of
      justice in a manner that is fair for emself, if not for the rest
      of Agora.

      When a CFJ has no judge assigned, the Arbitor CAN assign any
      player to be its judge by announcement, and SHALL do so within a
      week.  The players eligible to be assigned as judge are all
      players except the initiator and the person barred (if any).
      The Arbitor SHALL assign judges over time such that all
      interested players have reasonably equal opportunities to judge.
      If a CFJ has no judge assigned, then any player eligible to
      judge that CFJ CAN assign it to emself Without 3 Objections.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 591/43 (Power=1.7)
Delivering Judgements

      When a CFJ is open and assigned to a judge, that judge CAN
      assign a valid judgement to it by announcement, and SHALL do so
      in a timely fashion after this becomes possible.  If e does not,
      the Arbitor CAN remove em from being the judge of that case by
      announcement.

      The valid judgements for an inquiry case are as follows, based
          on the truth or falsity of the statement at the time the inquiry
          case was initiated (if its truth value changed at that time,
          then its initial truth value is used):

          * FALSE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
            logically false

          * TRUE, appropriate if the statement was factually and logically
            true

          * IRRELEVANT, appropriate if the veracity of the statement is
            not relevant to the game or is an overly hypothetical
            extrapolation of the game or its rules to conditions that
            don't actually exist, or if it can be trivially determined
            from the outcome of another (possibly still undecided)
            judicial case that was not itself judged IRRELEVANT

          * INSUFFICIENT, appropriate if the statement does not come with
            supporting arguments or evidence, and the judge feels as if an
            undue burden is being placed on em by the lack of arguments and
            evidence.  A CFJ judged as INSUFFICIENT CAN and SHOULD be
            submitted again with sufficient arguments/evidence.

          * DISMISS, appropriate if the statement is malformed, undecidable,
            if insufficient information exists to make a judgement with
            reasonable effort, or the statement is otherwise not able to be
            answered with another valid judgement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 911/51 (Power=1.7)
Motions and Moots

      If a CFJ (1) has a judgement that has been in effect for less
      than seven days and not been appealed, and (2) has not had a
      Motion to Reconsider filed for it at any time while it has been
      assigned to its current judge, then any Player CAN file a Motion
      to Reconsider the case with 2 Support, or by announcement if e
      is that case's judge.  When a Motion to Reconsider is so filed,
      the case is rendered open again.

      If a CFJ has a judgement assigned, a player CAN enter that
      judgement into Moot with two support.  When this occurs, the CFJ
      is suspended, and the Arbitor is once authorized to initiate the
      Agoran decision to determine public confidence in the judgement,
      which e SHALL do in a timely fashion.

      For this decision, the vote collector is the Arbitor and the
      valid options are AFFIRM, REMAND, and REMIT.  When the decision
      is resolved, the effect depends on the outcome:

      - AFFIRM, FAILED QUORUM: The judgement is reassigned to the case,
        and cannot be entered into Moot again.

      - REMAND: The case becomes open again.

      - REMIT: The case becomes open again, and the current judge is
        recused.  The Arbitor SHALL NOT assign em to the case again
        unless no other eligible judges have displayed interest in
        judging.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2175/9 (Power=1)
Judicial Retraction and Excess

      A new case is a judicial case that has not had any judge
      assigned to it.  The initiator of a new case CAN retract it by
      announcement, thus causing it to cease to be a judicial case.

      An excess case is a new case whose initiator previously
      initiated five or more cases during the same week as that case.
      A person SHALL NOT initiate an excess case.  The Arbitor CAN
      refuse an excess case by announcement, thus causing it to cease
      to be a judicial case.  When e does so, e fulfills any
      obligations with regards to that case.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2492/0 (Power=1)
Recusal

      A judge may recuse emself from a CFJ they are assigned to.

      When a judge recuses emself from a CFJ the following happens:
        1 - The CFJ becomes unassigned
        2 - The recused judge becomes ineligible to be assigned as a judge
            for a week.
        3 - The recused judge SHOULD suggest another judge for the CFJ to
            make the Arbitor's job easier.

Punishment
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2426/5 (Power=2)
Cards

      A Card is a recognition of a specific violation of the rules or
      other manner of infraction that is awarded to the violator in
      order to draw attention to eir disregard for the rule of law
      and, depending on the type of Card, to impose a penalty.

      Cards CANNOT be issued except by players by announcement. Any
      attempt to issue a Card, or any intent for a dependent action to
      issue a Card, is INEFFECTIVE if it does not include the
      following information:

      - The type of Card being issued,
      - The person to whom the Card is being issued (the bad sport),
        and
      - The specific action, inaction of the bad sport giving rise to
        the Card (the reason).

      Issuing Cards is secured with power threshold 1.7.

      The types of Card are defined by the rules. A type of Card may
      have a defined set of circumstances for which it is appropriate,
      as well as a penalty which takes effect when a Card of that type
      is issued.  Unless otherwise specified by the rule defining a
      type of Card, that Card type's penalty and circumstances for
      which it is appropriate are secured at the power threshold of
      that rule.

      A person SHALL NOT issue a Card unless:

      - the reason is appropriate for the type of Card being issued;
      - there has not already been a Card issued for that reason; and
      - the reason occurred within the 14 days preceding the issuance
        of the Card or, when the Card arises out of any manner of
        official proceeding, the initiation of that proceeding.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2477/1 (Power=1)
The Referee

      The Referee is an office; its holder is responsible for keeping
      track of and adjudicating wrongdoing.  The Referee's weekly

      days and the reasons therefor, as well as a list of all
      penalties due to Cards that are still in effect.

Rule 2478/1 (Power=1.7)
Vigilante Justice

      A player CAN by announcement, but subject to the provisions of
      this rule, Point eir Finger at a player, citing an alleged
      violation of the rules by that player.

      When a player Points a Finger, the investigator SHALL
      investigate the allegation and, in a timely fashion, SHALL
      conclude the investigation by:

       - issuing a Card to the pointed-at player by announcement whose
         reason is rooted in the allegation;

       - if e believes that no rules violation occurred or that it
         would be ILLEGAL to issue a Card for it, announcing the
         Finger Pointing to be Shenanigans.

      The Referee is by default the investigator for all Finger
      Pointing.  When a Finger, other than the Arbitor's, is Pointed
      over an allegation related to the official duties or powers of
      the Referee, then the Arbitor CAN, by announcement, take over
      the investigation and thereby become the investigator.

      A player CANNOT point a finger more than twice per Agoran week,
      or more than once per Agoran week at the same player.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2479/0 (Power=1.7)
Official Justice

      The Referee CAN, subject to the provisions of this rule, impose
      Summary Judgment on a player by issuing a card to em by
      announcement.

      The Referee CANNOT Point eir Finger or impose Summary Judgment
      more than five total times per week, or more than twice per week
      at or on the same player.

      As part of the Referee's weekly duties, e SHALL either impose
      Summary Judgment on a player or truthfully announce that e
      believes that there are no rules violations in the preceding
      Agoran week for which a Card has not already been issued.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2474/0 (Power=0.5)
Green Cards

      A Green Card is a type of Card that is appropriate for minor,
      accidental, and/or inconsequential infraction.  A Green Card is
      also appropriate for any infraction for which no other type of
      Card is appropriate.  When a person is issued a Green Card, they
      are ENCOURAGED to travel to the United States.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2427/2 (Power=2)
Yellow Cards

      A Yellow Card is a type of Card that is appropriate either for infractions
      that have a significant, though small, impact on gameplay or for
      infractions for which a Green Card has already been issued.

      When a Yellow Card is issued, the bad sport SHOULD publish a formal
      apology of at least 200 words explaining eir error, shame, remorse, and
      ardent desire for self-improvement. A player issuing a Yellow Card MAY,
      when doing so, additionally specify up to 10 words to be included in the
      apology. Until e publishes such an apology, as a penalty, the bad sport's
      voting strength on all Agoran decisions initiated within 30 days of the
      Card's issuance is set to 0 after modifiers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2475/0 (Power=2)
Red Cards

      A Red Card is a type of Card that is appropriate for serious and
      deliberate violations of the rules.  A Red Card is also
      appropriate for a person who appears to be part of an attempt in
      bad faith to swarm Agora and outpower the regular players in
      voting strength.

      When a Red Card is issued, as a penalty, within the next 7 days,
      any player CAN once, with 2 Support, Throw the Book at the bad
      sport.  When the Book is Thrown at the bad sport, eir voting
      strength on all Agoran decisions initiated during the first
      Agoran week which begins at least four days after the issuance
      of the Card is reduced by 2.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2476/0 (Power=1)
Pink Slips

      A Pink Slip is a type of Card that is appropriate for abuses of
      official power for personal gain.  A Pink Slip CANNOT be issued
      unless the reason indicates the specific office or offices whose
      power was abused.

      When a Pink Slip is issued, as a penalty, within the next 7
      days, any player CAN, with 2 Support, become the holder of one
      or more of those offices still held by the bad sport.

Winning
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2449/2 (Power=3)
Winning the Game

      When the Rules state that a person or persons win the game,
      those persons win the game; specifically they win the Round
      that ends with the indicated win.  Agora itself does not end and
      the ruleset remains unchanged. The Herald is then authorized to
      award those persons the Patent Title of Champion.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2448/3 (Power=1)
Eras

      An Era is a period of time that has a defined start, either
      has a defined end or is still ongoing, and has been initiated
      as specified by this rule.

      Upon the initiation of an Era, each existing Ephemeral Rule
      (in the order they were created) is repealed, unless the
      initiation specifies otherwise.

      A player CAN initiate a new Era with Agoran Consent.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 103/23 (Power=2)
The Speaker

      The Speaker is an imposed office and the figurehead leader of
      Agora.

      The player or players who have most recently won the game are
      called Laureled. If at any time the office of Speaker is vacant,
      or when one or more players win Agora, then the Prime Minister
      CAN and SHALL, once and in a timely fashion, appoint a Laureled
      player to the office of Speaker.

      If the office of Speaker has been held continuously by the same
      person for 90+ days, then any player CAN appoint another player
      to the office with Support.

      For an election of the Prime Minister, the Speaker has voting
      strength one greater than e would have if e did not hold the
      office.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2452/2 (Power=0.5)
Trust Tokens

      Any player can issue a Trust Token to another person by
      announcement.

      When the Assessor resolves a Decision to adopt a proposal, then
      any player who cast a valid vote on the Decision and was
      endorsed by another player's valid vote on the Decision is
      issued a Trust Token by the endorsing player.

      A person can win the game by announcement if e has been issued a
      Trust Token by each player except emself; if no person has won
      via this mechanism in the past; and if in the same message, e
      quotes, for each of those players, a public message in which
      that player issued em a Trust Token.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2465/0 (Power=0.3)
Victory by Apathy

      of players. Upon doing so, the specified players win the game.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2482/0 (Power=0.5)
Victory Elections

      If nobody has done so in the previous 180 days, the Herald CAN
      initiate a Victory Election, a type of Agoran decision. On such
      a decision, all players are valid options; non-player persons
      can also become valid options during the voting period by
      announcement. The vote collector is the Herald, and the voting
      method is instant runoff.

      Upon the resolution of the decision, if the outcome is a person,
      then that person wins the game.

======================================================================
Awards
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2438/5 (Power=3)
Ribbons

      The Tailor is an office, and the recordkeepor of Ribbons.

      Ribbon Ownership is a person switch, tracked by the Tailor in
      his monthly report, whose values are the subsets of the set of
      types of Ribbon, defaulting to the empty set.

      To "award a person a <Ribbon type>" is to add that type of
      Ribbon to that person's Ribbon Ownership. A person "owns a
      <Ribbon type>" if that type of Ribbon is an element of eir
      Ribbon Ownership.

      While a person qualifies for a type of Ribbon, any player can
      generally award em that type of Ribbon. A person qualifies for a
      type of Ribbon if e has earned that type of Ribbon within the
      preceding 7 days (including earlier in the same message) and has
      not owned that type of Ribbon within the preceding 7 days.

      While a person owns all types of Ribbon, that person can Raise a
      Banner by announcement. This causes that person to win the game.
      That person's Ribbon Ownership becomes the empty set.

      The types of Ribbon, and the methods of obtaining them, are as
      follows:

      Red (R): When a proposal is adopted and changes at least one
      rule with Power >= 3, its proposer earns a Red Ribbon.

      Orange (O): When a proposal is adopted via an Agoran Decision on
      which no valid votes were AGAINST, its proposer earns an Orange
      Ribbon.

      Green (G): While a person has held an elected office
      continuously for 30 days, and has not failed to perform any
      duties of that office within the appropriate time limits during
      those 30 days, that person qualifies for a Green Ribbon.

      Cyan (C): When a person deputises for an office, that person
      earns a Cyan Ribbon.

      Blue (B): When a person assigns a judgement to a CFJ, and has
      never violated a time limit to assign a judgement to that CFJ,
      that person earns a Blue Ribbon.

      Magenta (M): During Agora's Birthday, each person who has
      publicly acknowledged the fact qualifies for a Magenta Ribbon.

      Ultraviolet (U): When a person is awarded the Patent Title
      Champion, that person earns an Ultraviolet Ribbon.

      Violet (V): When a person is awarded a Patent Title other than
      Champion or a degree, that person earns a Violet Ribbon.

      Indigo (I): When a person is awarded a degree, that person earns
      an Indigo Ribbon.

      Platinum (P): The Speaker qualifies for a Platinum Ribbon.

      Lime (L): A person qualifies for a Lime Ribbon if three or more
      proposals adopted in the preceding 7 days had that person as a
      coauthor.

      White (W): A player qualifies for a White Ribbon if e has never
      previously owned a White Ribbon (including under previous
      rulesets). A player who has been registered for at least 30 days
      and has never caused another person to gain a White Ribbon
      (including under a previous ruleset) CAN award a White Ribbon to
      another person by announcement.

      Black (K): This rule does not specify any methods of obtaining
      Black Ribbons.

      Gray (A): The Tailor CAN award a Gray Ribbon by announcement,
      unless e has done so earlier in the month. E is ENCOURAGED to
      award such a Ribbon in the same message in which e publishes eir
      monthly report.

      Transparent (T): A person qualifies for a Transparent Ribbon
      while the number of other types of Ribbon that that person
      qualifies for and/or has earned within the previous 7 days is at
      least 5.

Rule 649/37 (Power=1.5)
Patent Titles

      A Patent Title is a legal title given to a person in recognition
      of the person's distinction.  The Herald is an office; its
      holder is responsible for tracking Patent Titles in eir monthly
      report.

      Awarding or revoking a Patent Title is secured.  A person
      permitted and enabled to award (revoke) a Patent Title SHALL do
      so in a timely fashion after the conditions authorizing em to do
      so are announced, unless there is an open judicial case
      contesting the validity of those conditions.

      player With 2 Agoran Consent.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2444/2 (Power=1)
Silver Quill

      The Silver Quill is an annual award designed to honor the
      authors of proposals of outstanding merit and influence on the
      game.

      In a timely fashion after the end of each Agoran Year, the
      Herald SHALL initiate and Agoran Decision to determine which
      Proposal has most greatly influenced that (ending) year of play.

      For this decision, the valid options are all proposals adopted
      between November 1 of the year prior to the ending year, and
      October 31 of the ending year.  The vote collector is the
      Herald, and the voting method is instant runoff.

      Players are ENCOURAGED to discuss which eligible proposals best
      satisfy the aforementioned criteria.  Proposals submitted by new
      players SHOULD be given somewhat higher weight, but the primary
      reference should be the proposals themselves and their effect on
      the game since adoption.

      Upon the resolution of the decision, if the outcome is not
      FAILED QUORUM and there were at least three votes containing it
      in any preference slot, that proposal wins the Ceremony, and the
      Herald is authorized to award its author the Patent Title of
      "Silver Quill YYYY, substituting the ending year; otherwise,
      there is no winner.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2415/0 (Power=1.5)
Badges

      A Badge is any patent title with the word 'badge' as part of
      its name.  A badge SHOULD be used to award multiple persons for
      participating in specific event of note within Agora.  Any
      player CAN award a badge that does not yet exist to three or
      more persons simultaneously, with Agoran Consent.  The Herald
      CAN award an existing badge to persons Without Objection.

      degrees listed later being ranked higher.  A specific degree
      CANNOT be awarded to any person more than once.

      A specified degree CAN be awarded with 2 Agoran Consent, and
      SHOULD only be awarded for the publication of an original
      thesis of scholarly worth (including responses to peer-review),
      published with explicit intent to qualify for a degree.  The
      Herald SHOULD coordinate the peer-review process and the
      awarding of degrees.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2231/5 (Power=3)
Order of the Hero of Agora Nomic

      Heroic titles are Agora's premier patent titles of distinction,
      and CAN be awarded to persons for meritorious service only by a
      proposal of power 3 or greater, which SHOULD explain why those
      persons are qualified.  Bearers of heroic titles (Heroes)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2423/3 (Power=2)
First Among Equals

      The Prime Minister is an office. The Prime Minister is elected
      by the players of Agora primarily on account of not being the
      other guy. The Prime Minister SHOULD ensure that Agoran affairs
      proceed smoothly.

      The holder of the office of Prime Minister's voting  strength is
      increased by 1 on all Agoran decisions other than a elections of

      character string "MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE" in the subject line.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2451/3 (Power=1.7)

      Once per week and except as otherwise forbidden by this
      rule, the current Prime Minister CAN issue a Cabinet Order

        issued.

      - Manifesto (Promotor): The Prime Minister distributes a
        specified proposal in the Proposal Pool.

Obligations
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2450/2 (Power=1.7)
Pledges

      A player SHALL NOT break eir own publicly-made pledges.

      A pledge may be considered broken if the pledger does not complete it
      in a timely manner after it becomes possible to do so. A pledge may be
      considered broken at the moment the pledger engages in conduct
      proscribed by that pledge.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2467/4 (Power=1)
Agencies

      An Agency is a document empowering persons to act on behalf of another
      player. A player MAY establish an Agency With 24 hours Notice, and thereby
      become its Director, by specifying the properties of the new Agency,
      provided e has not established any other Agency that day:

        1. A title, which must be exactly three words, not counting
           conjunctions, articles or prepositions.
        2. A non-empty list of persons other than the Director (the Agents).
        3. A description of a set of actions (the Powers).

      An Agency's Director may amend its properties or revoke it with 24 hours
      Notice. For greater certainty, an announced intent to create an Agency or
      amend an Agency's powers is INEFFECTIVE unless it explicitly specifies the
      new values of the properties being created or amended.

      The Powers of an Agency must be stated as actions, although they may may
      be conditional on date, time, game state, or other preconditions. If
      condition(s) are specified as necessary for a power to be used, it is
      limited; otherwise, it is unlimited. If it attempts to specify a power in
      a manner that is unclear, ambiguous, circular, inconsistent, paradoxical,
      or that depends on information that is impossible or unreasonably
      difficult to determine, then the specification of that power is invalid,
      and it CANNOT be used.

      An Agency, once created, SHOULD be referred to by the acronym formed from
      its title with conjunctions, articles, and prepositions removed. The
      acronym of an agency must be unique and any attempt to create or amend an
      Agency such that two Agencies would have the same acronym is INEFFECTIVE.

      The Agents of an Agency may perform the Actions described in the Powers of
      the Agency on behalf of the Agency's Director.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2468/2 (Power=1)

Rule 1727/19 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;

      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial
      Rulesets of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets
      of Nomic World and other nomics,

      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June 30,
      1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by FIRST SPEAKER
      Michael Norrish, which read, in part,

      > "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
      > precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think we
      > may as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules are
      > invited. In accordance with the rules, these will be
      > published, numbered and distributed by me at my earliest
      > convenience."

      And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic,
      known unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was played
      on, until its Players, much later, gave it its OFFICIAL NAME of
      Agora,

      And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest,
      and most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the hard
      work and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent advice of
      Agoraphobes,

      And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
      founding,

      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2464/1 (Power=1)
Tournaments

      A Tournament is a sub-game of Agora specifically sanctioned
      to be initiated as a tournament by the Rules.  If a winner of a
      tournament is determined within 4 weeks of its initiation, that
      person or persons win the game, otherwise the tournament
      concludes with no winner. A Tournament is governed by a special temporary
      title of the ACORN, created in accordance with its parent rule,
      which have binding control over those who freely agree to play the tournament
      and over the tournament itself. Once the tournament is concluded, these
      regulations cease to have any effect, and may be repealed by any player by
      announcement.

      The week that contains the beginning of Agora's Birthday,
      together with the following week, is a Holiday.

      If a person breaks a Rule by missing a deadline that occurs
      during a Holiday, punishment is generally not appropriate.

======================================================================
Organizations
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2459/3 (Power=1.2)
Organizations

      An Organization is a type of entity. The following changes are
      secured: creating, modifying, or destroying an Organization; and
      causing an entity to become an Organization or cease to be an
      Organization.

      The Income Cap is 100.

      Budget is a switch belonging to (Organization, player) pairs
      (i.e. there is one instance of the switch for each combination
      of an Organization and a player), tracked by the Secretary,
      whose legal values are integers from 0 to the Income Cap
      inclusive, defaulting to 0. An Organization's Income is the
      total value of all Budget switches for pairs that include that
      Organization. A player's Expenditure is the total value of all
      Budget switches for pairs that include that player. Changes to
      Budget are secured.

      A "member" of an Organization is a player for which the pair
      consisting of that Organization and that player has a nonzero
      Budget.

      It is IMPOSSIBLE, by any means, for a player to become a member
      of an Organization, or for an organization to be created with a
      player as a member, without that player's explicit, willful
      consent. This rule takes precedence over any rule that might
      make such a change possible.

      A member of an Organization CAN perform any action the rules authorize that
      Organization to perform, if the Organization's charter states that doing so
      is Appropriate.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2461/2 (Power=1.2)
Death and Birth of Organizations

      The Income Floor is 50.

      If an Organization's Income is ever lower than the Income Floor,
      then any player CAN destroy it by announcement, and the Secretary
      SHALL do so in a timely fashion if the situation persists.

      If a player's Expenditure is at most the Income Cap minus the
      Income Floor, and e is not on Lockout, then e CAN create an
      Organization by announcement, specifying a name for that
      Organization that is unique among Organizations, and a Charter.
      When an organization is created this way, its Charter is set to
      the value that e specified, and the Budget switch for that
      player and Organization is set to the Income Floor.

      Notwithstanding the above, a player CANNOT create more than one
      Organization in a day, and CANNOT create Organizations while e
      is a member of an Organization with an Income lower than the
      Income Floor.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2460/1 (Power=1.2)
Organizational Restructuring

      Charter is an Organization switch, tracked by the Secretary in
      eir monthly report, whose legal values are texts, and with
      default value "An amendment to this Organization is Appropriate
      if intent to perform it was announced between 4 and 14 days ago,
      and no members of the Organization have publicly objected to it
      since."

      A change to an instance of a Budget or Charter switch is known
      as an "amendment" to the Organization to which that instance of
      the switch applies. Each amendment to an Organization is
      considered to be either Appropriate or Inappropriate. An
      Organization's Charter SHOULD contain a method of determining
      the appropriateness of amendments to that Organization.

      If a Charter does not specify the appropriateness of an
      amendment to its Organization, or if it attempts to specify the
      appropriateness of such an amendment but in a way that is
      unclear, ambiguous, circular, inconsistent, paradoxical, or that
      depends on information that is impossible or unreasonably
      difficult to determine, the amendment is Inappropriate;
      otherwise, it is Appropriate if and only if the Charter
      specifies that it is.

      Organizations can be amended as follows:

      1. A member of an Organization CAN flip that Organization's
         Charter by announcement, if doing so is Appropriate, and that
         member is not on Lockout.
      2. Any player CAN flip a Budget Switch by announcement, if doing
         so is Appropriate and the player is not on Lockout, except
         where other rules prevent this.
      3. A member of an Organization CAN flip that Organization's
         Charter without objection, even if doing so is Inappropriate,
         as long as that member is not on Lockout. Players SHOULD only
         use this mechanism to recover from situations where the
         Charter is underspecified or has unintended effects.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2456/2 (Power=1)
The Secretary

      The Secretary is an office. The Secretary's weekly report
      includes:

      1. A list of which persons are on Personal Lockout.
      2. The time at which each person on Personal Lockout comes off
         Lockout.
      3. Whether Agora is on Global Lockout, and if so, when it ends.

Rule 2457/0 (Power=1.2)
Lockout

      There is such a thing as a Lockout Event, which can happen
      either to a person or to Agora as a whole. Lockout Events only
      happen when a Rule with power 1 or greater explicitly states
      that they happen.

      A person is on Personal Lockout if a Lockout Event happened to
      that person within the past 90 days.

      Agora is on Global Lockout if a Lockout Event happened to Agora
      as a whole within the past 7 days.

      A person is on Lockout if that person is on Personal Lockout,
      Agora is on Global Lockout, or both. A person is "off Lockout"
      if that person is not on Lockout.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2458/0 (Power=1.2)
Invoking Lockout

      A player who is not on Lockout can Invoke Lockout by
      announcement.

      player and a Lockout Event happens to Agora as a whole.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2462/5 (Power=1.7)
Bankruptcy

      While a player's Expenditure exceeds the Income Cap, then any
      player CAN cause that player to become Bankrupt by announcement,
      and the Secretary SHALL do so in a timely fashion if the
      situation persists.

      When a player becomes Bankrupt:

      1. All Budget switches for pairs including that player are
         flipped to 0.
      2. The Secretary CAN, and SHALL in a timely manner, award that
         player a Yellow Card.
      3. A Lockout Event happens to that player.

      previously-placed bid in the same auction.

      If, at the end of the auction, there is a single highest bid, then that
      player or Organization wins the auction. The player who placed the winning
      bid CAN cause Agora to transfer the auctioned Estate to the winner by
      announcement, by paying Agora the amount of the bid, or by causing the
      winning Organization to pay Agora the amount of the bid. E SHALL do so in
      a timely fashion.

      The Secretary may cause a Shiny Releveling event to occur without 3
      Objections.

Rule 2485/1 (Power=1)
You can't take it with you

      "Heir" is a person switch, tracked by the Registrar, whose value
      is either empty or the name of a player or Organization. Each
      person's Heir is empty by default. A player may flip eir Heir by
      announcement.

      When a player is deregistered, if eir Heir switch is not empty,
      e automatically pays all of eir Balance to the named player or
      Organization, and transfers all of eir Estates to the named
      player or Organization. Otherwise, if eir Heir switch is empty,
      e may specify another player, an Organization, or Agora, and pay
      all of eir Balance and transfer all of eir Estates to the
      specified player or Organization. If the player does not do so
      within 1 day of deregistration, the Registrar CAN and SHALL
      cause that player to pay eir Balance to Agora and to transfer
      all of eir Estates to Agora, by announcement.

Festivals

      Festivity is a singleton switch, whose possible values are integers
      ranging from 0 inclusive to the number of defined types of Ribbon
      exclusive, and defaulting to 0. While Agora's Festivity is 0,
      Festivity is tracked in the Tailor's monthly report. Otherwise, it
      is tracked in the Tailor's weekly report. Changes to Festivity are
      secured.

      If Agora's Festivity has had the same nonzero value for 14 days or
      more, any player may flip it to 0 by announcement.

      A player who owns at least N types of Ribbon may Start a Rank N
      Festival, where N is an integer greater than Agora's Festivity,
      with 4 Support from players who own at least N types of Ribbon.
      Upon doing so, Agora's Festivity is flipped to N. Exception: A
      player may not do so if Agora's Festivity has had a value greater
      than or equal to N within the past 21 days.

      A person who owns a number of types of Ribbon equal to or greater
      than Agora's Festivity is known as Festive. Other persons are not
      Festive.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2481/1 (Power=2.1)

         dependent action;

      2. Non-Festive players cannot flip the Imminence of any
         proposal;

      3. Quorum for Agoran Decisions is equal to half the number of
         Festive players, rounded up;

      4. Each Festive player has the maximum possible voting
         strength. All other players have the minimum possible voting
         strength.

      While Agora's Festivity is zero, the paragraphs above have no
