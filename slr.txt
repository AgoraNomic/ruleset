========================================================================
The Game of Agora
   This section includes a few rules concerning the Nature of the Game
   of Agora.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 101/17 (Power=4)
The Game of Agora

      Agora is a game of Nomic, wherein Persons, acting in accordance
      with the Rules, communicate their game Actions and/or results of
      these actions via Fora in order to play the game. The game may be
      won, but the game never ends.
      
      Please treat Agora Right Good Forever.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1698/6 (Power=4)
Agora Is A Nomic

      Agora is ossified if it is IMPOSSIBLE for any reasonable
      combination of actions by players to cause arbitrary rule changes
      to be made and/or arbitrary proposals to be adopted within a
      four-week period.
      
      If, but for this rule, the net effect of a proposal would cause
      Agora to become ossified, or would cause Agora to cease to exist,
      it cannot take effect, rules to the contrary notwithstanding. If
      any other single change or inseparable group of changes to the
      gamestate would cause Agora to become ossified, or would cause
      Agora to cease to exist, it is cancelled and does not occur, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Players
   This small section provides some rules detailing how joining and
   leaving Agora works. If you're a new player, this is probably the
   most important section to read.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 869/48 (Power=3)
How to Join and Leave Agora

      Any entity (including a group of confederated entities) that is or
      ever was able to willingly communicate original ideas is a person.
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no other entities are
      persons.
      
      Questions about personhood are to be resolved equitably, with
      regard for the good-faith of those involved and the customs of
      honorable play.
      
      Citizenship is a secured person switch with values Unregistered
      (default) and Registered, tracked by the Registrar. A registered
      person is a Player. To "register" someone is to flip that person's
      Citizenship switch from Unregistered to Registered.
      
      An Unregistered person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or
      prevented by the rules) register by publishing a message that
      indicates reasonably clearly and reasonably unambiguously that e
      intends to become a player at that time. No person can be a player
      if e is part of another player or another player is part of em.
      
      A player, acting as emself, CAN deregister (cease being a player)
      by announcement. If e does so, e CANNOT register or be registered
      for 30 days.
      
      A person, by registering, agrees to abide by the Rules. The Rules
      CANNOT otherwise bind a person to abide by any agreement without
      that person's willful consent.
      
      The Rules CANNOT compel non-players to act without their express
      or reasonably implied consent. The rules CANNOT compel players to
      unduly harass non-players. A non-person CANNOT be a player, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 478/40 (Power=3)
Fora

      Freedom of speech being essential for the healthy functioning of
      any non-Imperial nomic, it is hereby resolved that no Player shall
      be prohibited from participating in the Fora, nor shall any person
      create physical or technological obstacles that unduly favor some
      players' fora access over others.
      
      Publicity is a secured forum switch with values Public,
      Discussion, and Foreign (default), tracked by the Registrar.
      
      The Registrar may change the publicity of a forum without
      objection as long as:
      
      1. e sends eir announcement of intent to that forum; and
      
      2. if the forum is to be made public, the announcement by which
         the Registrar makes that forum public is sent to all existing
         public fora.
      
      Each player should ensure e can receive messages via each public
      forum.
      
      A public message is a message sent via a public forum, or sent to
      all players and containing a clear designation of intent to be
      public. A rule can also designate that a part of one public
      message is considered a public message in its own right. To
      "publish" or "announce" something is to send a public message
      whose body contains that thing. To do something "publicly" is
      to do that thing within a public message.
      
      Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
      announcement", that person performs that action by, in a single
      public message, specifying the action and setting forth intent to
      perform that action by sending that message, doing both clearly
      and unambiguously.
      
      Any action performed by sending a message is performed at the time
      date-stamped on that message. Actions in messages (including
      sub-messages) are performed in the order they appear in the
      message, unless otherwise specified. Allowing actions performed by
      sending a message to take place simultaneously must be done
      explicitly and is secured at power 2.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2139/17 (Power=2)
The Registrar

      The Registrar is an office; its holder is responsible for keeping
      track of players.
      
      The Registrar's weekly report includes:
      
      1. A list of all players, including information sufficient to
         identify and contact each player.
      
      2. The date on which each player most recently became a player.
      
      3. For each forum with non-Foreign publicity, sufficient
         instructions for players to receive messages there.
      
      The Registrar's monthly report includes:
      
      1. For each former player for which the information is reasonably
         available, the dates on which e registered and deregistered.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1789/11 (Power=3)
Cantus Cygneus

      Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously by
      the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part of
      it, e may submit a document to the Registrar, clearly labeled a
      Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and expressing eir
      reproach for those who e feels have treated em so badly.
      
      In a timely fashion after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the
      Registrar shall publish this document along with a Writ of
      Fugiendae Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione, commanding the Player
      to be deregistered. The Registrar shall note the method of
      deregistration for that Player in subsequent Registrar monthly
      Reports.
      
      The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and the
      notation in the Registrar's monthly report will ensure that,
      henceforth, all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of
      FAGE.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2646/1 (Power=1)
Activity

      Activity is a player switch tracked by the Registrar, with values
      Active (default) and Inactive.  To flip a player's activity to
      active (inactive) is to activate (deactivate) em.  The date on
      which each player's activity was last changed is part of the
      Registrar's weekly report.
      
      A player CAN, acting as emself, activate or deactivate emself by
      announcement.
      
      Any player CAN, with notice, make a player who has not made a
      public announcement in the past 30 days inactive.
      
      If a player has been inactive continuously for the past 60 days,
      then any player CAN deregister em without 3 objections. The
      Registrar SHOULD attempt to deregister players who meet this
      condition. The publication of intent for such a deregistration
      SHOULD be sent to the inactive player's registered email address
      at the same time that it is published.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
General Definitions
   This section describes the terminology used by all the other rules.
   If, when reading a rule, you don't understand what a word means,
   chances are that the Agoran definition of that word is described in
   one of these rules.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2152/9 (Power=3)
Mother, May I?

      The following terms are defined. These definitions are used when a
      rule includes a term in all caps, and provide guidance in
      determining the ordinary-language meaning of a term when a rule
      includes a term otherwise. Earlier definitions take precedence
      over later ones. If a rule specifies one or more persons in
      connection with a term, then the term applies only to the
      specified person(s).
      
      1. CANNOT, IMPOSSIBLE, INEFFECTIVE, INVALID: Attempts to perform
         the described action are unsuccessful.
      
      2. MUST NOT, MAY NOT, SHALL NOT, ILLEGAL, PROHIBITED: Performing
         the described action violates the rule in question.
      
      3. NEED NOT, OPTIONAL: Failing to perform the described action
         does not violate the rules.
      
      4. "SHOULD NOT, DISCOURAGED, DEPRECATED: Before performing the
         described action, the full implications of performing it ought
         to be be understood and carefully weighed.
      
      5. CAN, POSSIBLE: Attempts to perform the described action are
         successful.
      
      6. MAY: Performing the described action does not violate the
         rules.
      
      7. MUST, SHALL, REQUIRED, MANDATORY: Failing to perform the
         described action violates the rule in question.
      
      8. SHOULD, ENCOURAGED, RECOMMENDED: Before failing to perform the
         described action, the full implications of failing to perform
         it ought to be understood and carefully weighed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2509/2 (Power=2)
Agoran Numbers

      A "number" is considered to refer to a real number, unless
      otherwise explicitly specified.  A "number of (items)", where
      (items) is a set of discrete entities, is considered to refer to a
      non-negative integer, unless otherwise explicitly specified.
      
      If a switch is defined as being associated with a specified set of
      numbers (a numerical switch), then the possible values for that
      switch are the numbers in that set. In particular, a natural or
      integer switch is a switch with possible values the non-negative
      integers or all integers, respectively. If a limit is further
      defined, the possible values are the numbers of the set within the
      specified limits.
      
      If 0 is in the specified values for a numerical switch and no
      default value is otherwise specified, 0 is the default value for
      that switch.
      
      If the rules describe mathematical operations to be used in
      flipping an instance of a numerical switch, the operations are
      interpreted as having common-sense mathematical application to
      determine that instance's resulting value. For example,
      "increasing a switch instance by M" is equivalent to "flipping a
      switch instance from its current value N to the value N+M". If the
      specified mathematical operation would result in a value outside
      that switch's defined set, the flipping CANNOT be performed, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2125/13 (Power=3)
Regulated Actions

      An action is regulated if: (1) the Rules limit, allow, enable, or
      permit its performance; (2) the Rules describe the circumstances
      under which the action would succeed or fail; or (3) the action
      would, as part of its effect, modify information for which some
      player is required to be a recordkeepor.
      
      A Regulated Action CAN only be performed as described by the
      Rules, and only using the methods explicitly specified in the
      Rules for performing the given action. The Rules SHALL NOT be
      interpreted so as to proscribe unregulated actions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1023/40 (Power=2)
Agoran Time

      The following terms are defined:
      
      1. The phrase "in a timely fashion" means "within 7 days". This
         time period is set when the requirement is created (i.e. X days
         before the limit ends). A requirement to perform an action at
         an exact instant (e.g. "when X, Y SHALL Z"), but not "in the
         same message", is instead interpreted as a requirement to
         perform that action in a timely fashion after that instant.
      
      2. The phrase "in an officially timely fashion" means "before the
         end of the next Agoran week". This time period is set when the
         requirement is created (i.e. between 7 and 14 days before the
         period ends).
      
      3. Agoran epochs:
      
           1. Agoran days begin at midnight UTC.
      
           2. Agoran weeks begin at midnight UTC on Monday. Eastman
              weeks begin at midnight UTC on the 1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd,
              and 29th of each Gregorian month; the fifth one of the
              month (if any) lasts till the end of the month.
      
           3. Agoran months begin at midnight UTC on the first day of
              each Gregorian month.
      
           4. Agoran quarters begin when the Agoran months of January,
              April, July, and October begin.
      
           5. Agoran years begin when the Agoran month of January
              begins.
      
           6. A pivot is either the instant at which Agora Nomic began
              (June 30, 1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200) or an instant at which
              at least one person won the game. When used as a period of
              time, a "Round" (historical syn: "game") is the period of
              time between a pivot and the next pivot.
      
         The "Agoran" qualifier is assumed unless a different definition
         is indicated (e.g. Eastman weeks). These definitions do not
         apply to relative durations (e.g. "within <number> days after
         <event>").
      
      4. Two points in time are within a month of each other if:
      
          1. they occur in the same Agoran month;
      
          2. they occur in two consecutive Agoran months, and the later
             of the two occurs in an earlier day in the month than the
             earlier one;
      
          3. they occur in two consecutive Agoran months on the same day
             of the month, and the later of the two occurs at the same
             or earlier time of day.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1728/43 (Power=3)
Tabled Actions

      An action is a Tabled Action if it is performed with one of the
      following methods:
      * With N Support, where N is a positive integer.
      * Without N Objections, where N is a positive integer.
      * With N Agoran Consent, where N is a positive integer multiple of
        0.1.
      * With T notice, where T is a time period.
      
      The parameters N and T, if omitted, default to 1 and 4 days,
      respectively (e.g. "without objection" means N=1). If a rule
      defines N as less than 1 or greater than 8, it is instead treated
      as 1 or 8, respectively.
      
      A person CAN act on eir own behalf, by announcement, to table an
      intent (syn. "intend") to perform a tabled action, conspicuously
      and without obfuscation specifying the action, the method
      (including non- default parameter values), and optionally,
      conditions.
      
      A person is the sponsor of such an intent if e tabled it, or if e
      is authorized to perform its action due to holding a rule-defined
      position previously held by the person who tabled it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2124/30 (Power=3)
Performing Tabled Actions

      For a given tabled intent, a player CAN, unless otherwise
      forbidden by the rules or the document enabling the action, act on
      eir own behalf, by announcement, to:
      * Become a supporter ("support" it), unless e tabled or previously
        supported it;
      * Become an objector ("object to" it), unless e previously
        objected to it;
      * Cease to be a supporter or objector ("withdraw" support/objection).
      
      An intent is ripe if was tabled within the past 14 days, the
      Speaker hasn't objected to it in the past 48 hours, and its
      conditions, if any, are met.
      
      An intent is mature if it was tabled at least 4 days ago and
      nobody withdrew objections from it in the past 24 hours.
      
      A rule purporting to allow a person to perform a tabled action
      allows em to do so by announcement, if, considering only intents
      for that action/method combination:
      * With N Support: e is a sponsor or supporter of a ripe intent with
        at least N supporters.
      * Without N Objections: e is a sponsor of a mature ripe intent with
        less than N objectors.
      * With N Agoran Consent: e is a sponsor or supporter of a mature
        ripe intent with supporters greater than N times its objectors
        (e SHOULD list supporters and objectors).
      * With T notice: e is the sponsor of a ripe intent created at
        least T ago.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2518/0 (Power=3)
Determinacy

      If a value CANNOT be reasonably determined (without circularity or
      paradox) from information reasonably available, or if it
      alternates indefinitely between values, then the value is
      considered to be indeterminate, otherwise it is determinate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2505/1 (Power=1)
Random Choices

      When a Rule specifies that a random choice be made, then the
      choice shall be made using whatever probability distribution among
      the possible outcomes the Rule specifies, defaulting to a uniform
      probability distribution.
      
      The choice can be made using any physical or computational process
      whose probability distribution among the possible outcomes is
      reasonably close to that required by the Rules, and for which the
      final choice is not trivially predictable by the selecting person
      in advance. The selecting person SHOULD make the selection method
      public, and SHOULD use a method for which the final probability
      distribution can be readily confirmed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Entities
   "Entity" is a confusing word to new players. This section describes
   what an entity is.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1586/9 (Power=2)
Definition and Continuity of Entities

      If multiple rules attempt to define an entity with the same name,
      then they refer to the same entity. A rule-defined entity's name
      CANNOT be changed to be the same as another rule-defined entity's
      name.
      
      A rule, contract, or regulation that refers to an entity by name
      refers to the entity that had that name when the rule first came
      to include that reference, even if the entity's name has since
      changed.
      
      If the entity that defines another entity is amended such that it
      no longer defines the second entity, then the second entity and
      its attributes cease to exist.
      
      If the entity that defines another entity is amended such that it
      defines the second entity both before and after the amendment, but
      with different attributes, then the second entity and its
      attributes continue to exist to whatever extent is possible under
      the new definitions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2162/14 (Power=3)
Switches

      A type of switch is a property that the rules define as a switch,
      and specify the following:
      
      1. The type(s) of entity possessing an instance of that switch. No
         other entity possesses an instance of that switch.
      
      2. One or more possible values for instances of that switch,
         exactly one of which should be designated as the default. No
         values other than those listed are possible for instances of
         that switch, except that, if no default is otherwise
         specified, then rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the
         "null" value is a possible value for that switch, and is the
         default.
      
      3. Optionally, exactly one office whose holder tracks instances of
         that switch. That officer's (weekly, if not specified
         otherwise) report includes the value of each instance of that
         switch whose value is not its default value; a public document
         purporting to be this portion of that officer's report is
         self-ratifying, and implies that other instances are at their
         default value.
      
      At any given time, each instance of a switch has exactly one
      possible value for that type of switch. If an instance of a switch
      comes to have a value, it ceases to have any other value. If an
      instance of a switch would otherwise fail to have a possible
      value, it comes to have its default value. A Rule that designates
      a switch as "secured" (at a given power level) designates changes
      to the properties of that type of switch as secured (at that power
      level) and designates changes to the value of each instance of the
      switch as secured (at that power level).
      
      "To flip an instance of a switch" is to make it come to have a
      given value. "To become X" (where X is a possible value of
      exactly one of the subject's switches) is to flip that switch to
      X.
      
      If a type of switch is not explicitly designated as
      possibly-indeterminate by the rule that defines it, and if an
      action or set of actions would cause the value of an instance of
      that type of switch to become indeterminate, that instance instead
      takes on its last determinate and possible value, if any,
      otherwise it takes on its default value.
      
      A singleton switch is a switch for which Agora Nomic is the only
      entity possessing an instance of that switch.
      
      A boolean switch is a switch with values True and False. A
      positive boolean switch has a default of True; a negative boolean
      switch has a default of False.
      
      Attempting to flip an instance of a switch to a value it already
      has does not flip the switch. However, if a person is REQUIRED to
      flip a switch instance to a value it already has, then either
      attempting to do so using the required mechanism, or announcing
      that the switch already has the required value, fulfills the
      requirement without flipping the switch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1688/11 (Power=3)
Power

      The Power of an entity is a non-negative rational number. An
      instrument is an entity with positive Power.
      
      The Power of an entity cannot be set or modified except as
      stipulated by the Rules. All entities have Power zero except where
      specifically allowed by the rules.
      
      A Rule that makes a change, action, or value secured (hereafter
      the securing Rule) thereby makes it IMPOSSIBLE to perform that
      change or action, or to set or modify that value, except as
      allowed by an instrument with Power greater than or equal to the
      change's Power Threshold. This Threshold defaults to the securing
      Rule's Power, but CAN be lowered as allowed by that Rule
      (including by the Rule itself).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2140/5 (Power=3)
Power Controls Mutability

      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no entity with power below
      the power of this rule can
      
      1. cause an entity to have power greater than its own.
      
      2. adjust the power of an instrument with power greater than its
      own.
      
      3. set or modify any other substantive aspect of an instrument
      with power greater than its own (that is, one that affects the
      instrument's operation).

Proposals
   Proposals are a staple of Nomic games. If you're a new player, this
   is another important section, since the way proposals work in this
   Nomic is a little bit complicated.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2350/16 (Power=3)
Proposals

      A proposal is a type of entity consisting of a body of text and
      other attributes. A player CAN create a proposal by announcement,
      specifying its text and optionally specifying any of the following
      attributes:
      
      * An associated title.
      
      * A list of coauthors (which must be persons other than the
        author).
      
      * An adoption index.
      
      Creating a proposal adds it to the Proposal Pool. Once a proposal
      is created, its text, author, and AI cannot be changed. The author
      (syn. proposer) of a proposal is the person who submitted it.
      
      The author of a proposal in the Proposal Pool CAN remove (syn.
      retract, withdraw) it from the Pool by announcement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2622/4 (Power=1.0)
Pending Proposals

      Pended is an untracked negative boolean proposal switch.
      
      Any player CAN pay 1 Pendant to flip the Pended switch of a
      specified proposal to True. When e does so, the proposal becomes
      sponsored.
      
      The Promotor CAN, with 2+X support, flip the Pended switch of a
      proposal in the Proposal Pool to true. For this, X is equal to the
      number of times e has done so in the past 7 days.
      
      Any player CAN, without objection, flip the Pended switch of a
      proposal in the Proposal Pool to true.
      
      A proposal with a Pended switch set to True is 'pending'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2625/1 (Power=1.0)
Proposal Recycling

      If a referendum on a proposal was resolved as FAILED QUORUM in the
      last seven days, the Promotor CAN once recycle the proposal by
      announcement, adding it to the Proposal Pool and causing it to
      become pended.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2605/2 (Power=2.0)
Ministries

      A Ministry is an entity defined as such by this rule. Each
      Ministry has a goal. The Ministries of Agora, and their goals,
      are as follows:
      
      A. Ministry of Compliance: Ensure players follow rules and
      voluntary agreements and receive appropriate sanctions when they
      do not.
      B. Ministry of Legislation: Enable and encourage gameplay
      related to the rules themselves.
      C. Ministry of Economy: Enable and encourage gameplay related to
      assets and currencies.
      D. Ministry of Legacy: Track and reward great Agoran
      achievements
      E. Ministry of Participation: Track information about the
      participation of people in Agora.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2606/3 (Power=2.0)
Proposal Classes

      Proposals created since the enactment of this rule have a secured
      untracked Class switch with possible values ordinary (the default)
      and democratic.
      
      When a proposal with an adoption index greater than or equal to
      3.0 is created, its class becomes democratic.
      
      Any player CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, flip an ordinary proposal's
      class to democratic, provided that it is in the Proposal Pool or
      that there is an referendum on it whose voting period has not yet
      ended.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1607/53 (Power=3)
Distribution

      The Promotor is an office; its holder is responsible for receiving
      and distributing proposals.
      
      A referendum is the Agoran decision to determine whether to adopt
      a proposal.  For this decision, the vote collector is the
      Assessor, the adoption index is initially the adoption index of
      the proposal, or 1.0 if the proposal does not have one, and the
      text, author, coauthors, and class of the proposal are essential
      parameters. Initiating a referendum is known as distribution, and
      removes the proposal from the Proposal Pool.
      
      The Promotor CAN distribute a proposal which is in the Proposal
      Pool at any time, but SHALL NOT do so unless it is pending.
      
      In a given Agoran week, the Promotor SHALL distribute each
      proposal that was in the Proposal Pool and pending at the
      beginning of that week, except for those excepted from automatic
      distribution by other rules, or those that are otherwise removed
      from the Pool. If there are ten or more pending undistributed
      proposals in the proposal pool, the promotor MAY refrain from
      distributing the most recently added 5 proposals if e distributes
      each other pending proposal in that Agoran week.
      
      If a proposal has been in the proposal pool for more than 7 days
      and is not pending, the Promotor CAN and SHOULD remove it from the
      Pool by announcement.
      
      Distributed proposals have ID numbers, to be assigned by the
      Promotor.
      
      If there is a Proposal in the Pool that it would otherwise be
      IMPOSSIBLE for any player to distribute, then any player CAN
      distribute that Proposal without 3 objections.
      
      The Promotor's report includes a list of all proposals in the
      Proposal Pool, along with their text and attributes. This portion
      of a public document purporting to be a Promotor's report is
      self-ratifying.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2137/2 (Power=1)
The Assessor

      The Assessor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      collecting votes and keeping track of related properties.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 106/44 (Power=3)
Adopting Proposals

      When a referendum on a proposal is resolved, if the outcome is
      ADOPTED, then the proposal in question is adopted, its power is
      set to the minimum of four and its adoption index, and it takes
      effect. Proposals CANNOT otherwise be adopted or take effect,
      rules to the contrary notwithstanding.
      
      When a proposal takes effect, the proposal applies the changes
      that it specifies, except as prohibited by other rules. Clearly
      marked comments are ignored. If the proposal cannot make some
      changes it specifies, that does not preclude the other changes
      from taking place.
      
      Except insofar as the actions performed by a proposal happen one
      after another, rather than simultaneously, a proposal's effect is
      instantaneous. A proposal can neither delay nor extend its own
      effect.  Once a proposal finishes taking effect, its power is set
      to 0.
      
      No entity with power below the power of this rule can prevent a
      proposal from taking effect; this does not apply to generally
      preventing changes to specified areas of the gamestate, nor to a
      proposal preventing itself from taking effect (its no-effect
      clause is generally interpreted as applying only to the rest of
      the proposal).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2623/4 (Power=1.0)
Popular Proposal Proposer Privilege

      For a referendum, let F be the total number of valid ballots
      resolving to FOR, A be the same for AGAINST, and T be the total
      number of valid ballots.  The referendum's popularity is equal to
      (F - A)/T. The Assessor SHOULD publish the popularity of each
      referendum when resolving it.
      
      The author of the most popular sponsored proposal adopted in the
      last 7 days CAN once gain one Legislative Card by announcement,
      provided that no referenda initiated in the same message as it
      remain unresolved. If there is a tie, all authors of the tied
      proposals can do so once each.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2649/0 (Power=1)
Vocal Voter Verification Award

      The sole player, if any, who had the highest voting strength among
      all votes cast on all decisions resolved in the last 7 days CAN
      once grant emself 7 boatloads of coins by announcement, provided
      that no referenda initiated in the same message as it remain
      unresolved.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Rules & Regulations
   Ah, yes. What would any game be without rules? And these rules
   describe how rules work. This section also describes the governance
   of the Rulekeepor.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2141/16 (Power=3.2)
Role and Attributes of Rules

      A rule is a type of instrument that is always taking effect and
      has the capacity to govern the game generally. A rule's content
      takes the form of a text, and is unlimited in scope. The ruleset
      is the set of all currently-existing rules.
      
      Every current rule has power between 0.1 and 4.0 inclusive.
      
      Every rule shall have an ID number, distinct among current and
      former rules, to be assigned once by the Rulekeepor by public
      designation.
      
      Every rule shall have a title to aid in identification. If a rule
      ever does not have a title, then the Rulekeepor CAN and SHALL
      assign a title to it by announcement in a timely fashion.
      
      For the purposes of rules governing modification of instruments,
      the text, power, ID number, and title of a rule are all
      substantive aspects of the rule. However, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the Rulekeepor CAN set rule aspects as described
      elsewhere in this rule.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 217/12 (Power=3)
Interpreting the Rules

      When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
      takes precedence. Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
      unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense, past
      judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the game.
      
      Definitions and prescriptions in the rules are only to be applied
      using direct, forward reasoning; in particular, an absurdity that
      can be concluded from the assumption that a statement about
      rule-defined concepts is false does not constitute proof that it
      is true. Definitions in lower-powered Rules do not overrule
      common-sense interpretations or common definitions of terms in
      higher-powered rules, but may constructively make reasonable
      clarifications to those definitions. For this purpose, a
      clarification is reasonable if and only if it adds detail without
      changing the underlying general meaning of the term and without
      causing the higher powered rule to be read in a way inconsistent
      with its text.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any rule change that would
      (1) prevent a person from initiating a formal process to resolve
      matters of controversy, in the reasonable expectation that the
      controversy will thereby be resolved; or (2) prevent a person from
      causing formal reconsideration of any judicial determination that
      e should be punished, is wholly void and without effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1030/13 (Power=3.3)
Precedence between Rules

      In a conflict between Rules, the conflict shall be resolved by
      performing the following comparisons in the sequence written in
      this rule, until the conflict is resolved.
      
      - In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
        the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
        Power; otherwise,
      
      - If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
        precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
        determining precedence relations, then the determinations of the
        precedence-determining Rule shall be used to resolve the
        conflicts; otherwise,
      
      - If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
        itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or takes
        precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
        provisions shall be used to resolve the conflict, unless they
        lead to contradictions between each other; otherwise,
      
      - If any of the rules in conflict have ID numbers, then the Rule
        with the lowest ID number takes precedence; otherwise,
      
      - The Rule enacted earliest takes precedence.
      
      Clauses in any other rule that broadly claim precedence (e.g. over
      "all rules" of a certain class) shall be, prima facie, considered
      to be limited claims of precedence or deference that are
      applicable only when such claims are evaluated as described within
      the above sequence.
      
      No change to the ruleset can occur that would cause a Rule to
      directly claim precedence over this Rule as a means of determining
      precedence. This applies to changes by the enactment or amendment
      of a Rule, or of any other form. This Rule takes precedence over
      any Rule that would permit such a change to the ruleset.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2240/1 (Power=3)
No Cretans Need Apply

      In a conflict between clauses of the same Rule, if exactly one
      claims precedence over the other, then it takes precedence;
      otherwise, the later clause takes precedence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 105/22 (Power=3)
Rule Changes

      When the rules provide that an instrument takes effect, it can
      generally:
      
      1. enact a rule. The new rule has power equal to the minimum of
         the power specified by the enacting instrument, defaulting to
         one if the enacting instrument does not specify or if it
         specifies a power less than 0.1, and the maximum power
         permitted by other rules. The enacting instrument may specify a
         title for the new rule, which if present shall prevail. The ID
         number of the new rule cannot be specified by the enacting
         instrument; any attempt to so specify is null and void.
      
      2. repeal a rule. When a rule is repealed, it ceases to be a rule,
         its power is set to 0, and the Rulekeepor need no longer
         maintain a record of it.
      
      3. reenact a rule. A repealed rule identified by its most recent
         rule number MUST be reenacted with the same ID number and the
         next change identifier. If no text is specified, the rule is
         reenacted with the same text it had when it was most recently
         repealed. If the reenacting proposal provides new text for the
         rule, the rule SHOULD have materially the same purpose as did
         the repealed version. Unless specified otherwise by the
         reenacting instrument, a reenacted rule has power equal to the
         power it had at the time of its repeal (or power 1, if power
         was not defined at the time of that rule's repeal). If the
         reenacting instrument is incapable of setting the reenacted
         rule's power to that value, then the reenactment is null and
         void.
      
      4. amend the text of a rule.
      
      5. retitle a rule.
      
      6. change the power of a rule.
      
      A rule change is any effect that falls into the above classes.
      Rule changes always occur sequentially, never simultaneously.
      
      Any ambiguity in the specification of a rule change causes that
      change to be void and without effect. An inconsequential variation
      in the quotation of an existing rule does not constitute ambiguity
      for the purposes of this rule, but any other variation does.
      
      A rule change is wholly prevented from taking effect unless its
      full text was published, along with an unambiguous and clear
      specification of the method to be used for changing the rule, at
      least 4 days and no more than 60 days before it would otherwise
      take effect.
      
      This rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be
      created, modified, or destroyed, or by which an entity can become
      a rule or cease to be a rule.

Rule 2493/8 (Power=3)
Regulations

      A regulation is an textual entity defined as such by this rule,
      and under the authority of an person, known as its Promulgator. A
      regulation must be authorized by a rule (its parent rule) in order
      to exist. It has only the effect that rule explicitly gives it.
      
      A regulation CAN be enacted, amended, and repealed as specified by
      its parent rule. By default, a person CAN, with 2 Agoran consent,
      enact, amend, or repeal a regulation for which e is the
      Promulgator. Regulations are tracked by the Rulekeepor as part of
      eir weekly and monthly reports in a fashion similar to rules.

Rule 1051/17 (Power=1)
The Rulekeepor

      The Rulekeepor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      maintaining the text of the rules of Agora.
      
      The Rulekeepor's Weekly report includes the Short Logical Ruleset.
      The Rulekeepor's Monthly report includes the Full Logical Ruleset.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1681/23 (Power=1)
The Logical Rulesets

      The Short Logical Ruleset (SLR) is a format of the ruleset. In
      this format, each rule is assigned to a category, and the rules
      are grouped according to their category.
      
      Rules are assigned to, ordered within, or moved between
      categories, and categories are added, changed, or empty categories
      removed, as the Rulekeepor sees fit.
      
      The listing of each rule in the SLR must include the rule's ID
      number, revision number, power, title, and text.
      
      The Rulekeepor is strongly DISCOURAGED from including any
      additional information in the SLR, except that which increases the
      readability of the SLR.
      
      The Full Logical Ruleset (FLR) is a format of the ruleset. In this
      format, rules are assigned to the same category and presented in
      the same order as in the SLR. The FLR must contain all the
      information required to be in the SLR, and any historical
      annotations which the Rulekeepor is required to record.
      
      The Rulekeepor SHOULD also include any other information which e
      feels may be helpful in the use of the ruleset in the FLR.
      
      Whenever a rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeepor SHALL record
      and thereafter maintain a reasonably accurate historical
      annotation to the rule indicating:
      
      1. The type of change.
      
      2. The date on which the change took effect.
      
      3. The mechanism that specified the change.
      
      4. If the rule was changed due to a proposal, then that proposal's
         ID number, author, and coauthor(s) (if any).

      place of a word or phrase, in the rule's text and/or title; the
      rule is amended by this rule as specified by that person.

Rule 2614/9 (Power=3.1)
Eclipse Light

      An emergency message is one whose subject line contains the text
      "[Emergency]".
      
      The Prime Minister CAN, in an emergency message and with 3 Agoran
      consent, enact, amend, or repeal Emergency Regulations, provided
      that the intent to do so was also contained in an emergency
      message. To the extent explicitly permitted by this rule,
      Emergency regulations are always taking effect.
      
      Emergency Regulations CAN, as part of their effect:
        - Extend any deadline provided for by any instrument other than
          this rule, including a deadline for an obligation to be met,
          or deadline prior to which an action must be performed in
          order to be valid, such as the end of voting period. Such an
          extension CANNOT cause the total time period, such as the
          time from when an obligation was created to the deadline or
          the whole of a voting period, to be more than double its
          original length.
        - Create, destroy, or transfer assets, or require or forbid
          their creation, destruction, or transfer.
        - Collectively, exercise Mint Authority
        - Cause one or more players to win Agora.
        - Appoint or remove officeholders, other than Prime Minister or
          Speaker.
        - Modify the Festivity.
        - Award Patent Titles that are either Badges or are not
          mentioned in any Rule.
        - Modify the Publicity of Fora.
      
      The Prime Minister CAN, in an emergency message and with 4 Agoran
      Consent, provided that the intent to do so was also contained in
      an emergency message, Extend the Emergency.
      
      If there is an Emergency Regulation that has existed for at least
      a month and the Prime Minister has not Extended the Emergency in
      the past month, any player CAN, with 7 days notice, cause this
      rule to repeal all Emergency Regulations.
      
      If the Prime Minister has not sent a message to a public forum in
      the preceding four days, the Speaker CAN exercise eir powers under
      this rule as if e were the Prime Minister, and notwithstanding any
      rule that would prohibit a single player from holding both
      offices.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, Emergency Regulations
      CANNOT be enacted, amended, or repealed except as described in
      this Rule.

Agoran Decisions

      When the rules call for an Agoran decision to be made, the

      stages, each described elsewhere:
      
      1. Initiation of the decision.
      
      2. Voting of the people.
      
      3. Resolution of the decision.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 107/24 (Power=3)
Initiating Agoran Decisions

      An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
      initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
      to initiate the decision. To be valid, the notice must clearly
      specify the following information:
      
      1. The matter to be decided (for example, "the adoption of
         proposal 4781");
      
      2. The voting method;
      
      3. A clear description of the valid options;
      
      4. The identity of the vote collector; and
      
      5. Any additional information defined by the rules as essential
         parameters.
      
      The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting period
      for the decision. The default length of the voting period is 7
      days. Changing the length of a decision's voting period is secured
      at power 2, and it CANNOT be set or changed to more than 14 days,
      or less than 5 days for a decision with at least two options.
      
      The vote collector for a decision with less than two options CAN
      end the voting period by announcement, if it has not ended
      already, and provided that e resolves the decision in the same
      message.
      
      A public notice purporting to initiate an Agoran decision is a
      self-ratifying attestation of the notice's validity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2528/0 (Power=3)
Voting Methods

      Each Agoran decision has a voting method, which must be
      AI-majority, instant runoff, or first-past-the-post. The voting
      method is that specified by the authorizing authority, or
      first-past-the-post by default.
      
      Each Agoran decision has a set of valid options (the choices that
      the voters are being asked to select from) and valid votes (the
      ways in which the voters can express their opinion or lack
      thereof. For AI-majority decisions, the valid options are FOR and
      AGAINST; for other decisions, the valid options are defined by
      other rules.
      
      The valid votes on an Agoran decision are:
      
      1. PRESENT;
      
      2. The valid conditional votes, as defined by rules of power at
         least that of this rule; and
      
      3. For an instant runoff decision, the ordered lists of entities.
      
      4. For any other decision, the valid options.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 683/27 (Power=3)
Voting on Agoran Decisions

      An entity submits a ballot on an Agoran decision by publishing a
      notice satisfying the following conditions:
      
      1. The ballot is submitted during the voting period for the
         decision.
      
      2. The entity casting the ballot (the voter) was, at the
         initiation of the decision, a player.
      
      3. The ballot clearly identifies the matter to be decided.
      
      4. The ballot clearly identifies a valid vote, as determined by
         the voting method.
      
      5. The ballot clearly sets forth the voter's intent to place
         the identified vote.
      
      6. The voter has no other valid ballots on the same decision.
      
      A valid ballot is a ballot, correctly submitted, that has not been
      withdrawn. During the voting period of an Agoran decision, an
      entity CAN by announcement withdraw (syn. retract) a ballot that e
      submitted on that decision. To "change" one's vote is to retract
      eir previous ballot (if any), then submit a new one. Submitting
      and withdrawing ballots is secured.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 208/14 (Power=3)
Resolving Agoran Decisions

      The vote collector for an unresolved Agoran decision CAN resolve
      it by announcement, indicating the outcome. If it was required to
      be initiated, then e SHALL resolve it in a timely fashion after
      the end of the voting period. To be EFFECTIVE, such an attempt
      must satisfy the following conditions:
      
      1. It is published after the voting period has ended.
      
      2. It clearly identifies the matter to be resolved.
      
      3. It specifies the number of voters (or a list of the voters).
         For these purposes and for determining quorum, a "voter" is
         someone who submitted a ballot on the decision that was valid
         when it was submitted and also valid (i.e. not withdrawn or
         otherwise invalidated) at the end of the voting period.
      
      4. It specifies the outcome, as described elsewhere, and, if there
         was more than one valid option, provides a tally of the voters'
         valid ballots.
      
      Each Agoran decision has exactly one vote collector, defaulting to
      the initiator of the decision. If the vote collector is defined by
      reference to a position (or, in the default case, if the initiator
      was so defined), then the vote collector is the current holder of
      that position.
      
      This rule takes precedence over any rule that would provide
      another mechanism by which an Agoran decision may be resolved.
      
      In general, changes to the gamestate due to the outcome of an
      Agoran decision take effect when the decision is resolved.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 955/27 (Power=3)
Determining the Will of Agora

      Each Agoran decision has a voting method, which determines how
      voters may vote on it and how to calculate the outcome. The
      strength of a ballot is the voting strength of the voter who cast
      it on that Agoran decision, as calculated at the end of that
      decision's voting period.
      
      1. For an AI-majority decision, let F be the total strength of all
         valid ballots cast FOR a decision, A be the same for AGAINST,
         and AI be the adoption index of the decision. The outcome is
         ADOPTED if F/A >= AI and F/A > 1 (or F>0 and A=0), otherwise
         REJECTED.
      
      2. For an instant runoff decision, the outcome is whichever option
         wins according to the standard definition of instant runoff.
         For this purpose, a ballot of strength N is treated as if it
         were N distinct ballots expressing the same preferences. In
         case multiple valid options tie for the lowest number of votes
         at any stage, the vote collector CAN and must, in the
         announcement of the decision's resolution, select one such
         option to eliminate; if, for M > 1, all eir possible choices in
         the next M stages would result in the same set of options being
         eliminated, e need not specify the order of elimination. If an
         entity that is part of a valid vote is not a valid option at
         the end of the voting period, or disqualified by the rule
         providing for the decision, then that entity is eliminated
         prior to the first round of counting.
      
      3. For a first-past-the-post decision, the outcome is whichever
         option received the highest total strength of valid ballots. In
         case of a tie, the vote collector CAN and must, in the
         announcement of the decision's resolution, select one of the
         leaders as the outcome.
      
      The previous notwithstanding:
      
      - If there is more than one option, and the number of voters is
        less than the quorum of that decision, the outcome is instead
        FAILED QUORUM.
      
      - If there are no valid options, the outcome is null.
      
      The outcome of a decision is determined when it is resolved, and
      cannot change thereafter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 879/39 (Power=2)
Quorum

      Each Agoran decision has a quorum. This is a number set when the
      decision is created, and thereafter cannot be changed. When a
      person initiates an Agoran decision, that person SHALL state the
      quorum of that decision. However, incorrectly stating the quorum
      of a decision does not invalidate the initiation, nor does it
      actually change the quorum of the decision.
      
      The quorum that an Agoran decision gains as it is created can be
      defined by other rules of power 2 or greater. If no other rule
      defines the quorum of an Agoran decision, the quorum for that
      decision is equal to 2/3 of the number of voters on the referendum
      that had been most recently resolved at the time of that
      decision's initiation, the whole rounded to the nearest integer.
      
      As an exception to the previous paragraph, the quorum of an
      Agoran decision can never be less than 2. If the rules would
      attempt to set the quorum of an Agoran decision to less than 2,
      it is set to 2 instead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2422/10 (Power=3)
Voting Strength

      The voting strength of an entity on an Agoran decision is an
      integer between 0 and 15 inclusive, defined by rules of power 2
      or greater. If not otherwise specified, the voting strength of
      an entity on an Agoran decision is 3.
      
      When multiple rules set or modify an entity's voting strength on
      an Agoran decision, it shall be determined by first applying the
      rule(s) which set it to a specific value, using the ordinary
      precedence of rules, and then applying the rules, other than
      this one, which modify it, in numerical order by ID. Finally, if
      the result of the calculation is not an integer, it is rounded
      up, and then if it is outside the allowable range of values for
      voting strength, it is set to the minimum value if it was less
      and the maximum value if it was more.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2653/2 (Power=2)
Buying Strength

      A player CAN Buy Strength by paying a fee of 1 Votive. A person's
      Voting Strength on a referendum on an ordinary proposal is 1
      greater for every time e Bought Strength during that decision's
      voting period.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2127/11 (Power=3)
Conditional Votes

      A conditional vote on an Agoran decision is a vote which indicates
      a vote based on some condition(s). A conditional vote is evaluated
      at the end of the voting period and, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, is clearly specified if and only if the value of
      the condition(s) is/are determinate at the end of the voting
      period. If the conditional is clearly specified, and evaluates to
      a valid vote, it is counted as that vote; otherwise, it is counted
      as PRESENT.
      
      Any vote which is clearly expressed as a conditional, e.g. "FOR if
      <X> is true, AGAINST otherwise", is a valid conditional vote that
      evaluates as specified.
      
      A vote endorsing another person is equivalent to a conditional
      vote evaluating to the vote specified in that person's valid
      ballot on the decision, if any.
      
      For an instant runoff decision, a vote consisting of a list, one
      or more entries of which are valid conditional votes, and the
      remaining entries of which are valid options, is a valid
      conditional vote. Such a vote is evaluated by evaluating each
      conditional entry to a list of votes (or an empty list, if it
      evaluates to PRESENT either directly or indirectly), and then
      concatenating those lists with the specified valid options in the
      order they occurred in the original vote.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2168/9 (Power=2)
Extending the Voting Period

      Whenever the voting period of an Agoran decision would end, and
      the result would be FAILED QUORUM, the length of the voting period
      for that decision is instead increased to 14 days, except if it is
      already that length, provided this has not already happened for
      the decision in question.
      
      Within four days of such an occurrence, the vote collector for the
      decision SHALL issue a humiliating public reminder naming the
      slackers who have not yet cast any votes on it despite being
      eligible, and CAN end its voting period by announcement (resolving
      it constitutes an implicit announcement that its voting period is
      first ended) if the result would no longer be FAILED QUORUM, or if
      the decision is a referendum on a proposal and no voter (other
      than possibly the proposal's author) has voted FOR.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1950/37 (Power=3)
Decisions with Adoption Indices

      Adoption index (AI) is an untracked switch possessed by Agoran
      decisions and proposals, secured at power 2.  For decisions, the
      possible values are "none" (default) or integral multiples of 0.1
      from 1.0 to 9.9. For proposals, the possible values are integral
      multiples of 0.1 from 1.0 to 9.9 (default 1.0). If a referendum
      has an adoption index less than the adoption index of its
      associated proposal, the referendum's adoption index is
      immediately set to that of the associated proposal
      
      Adoption index is secured with a Power Threshold of 2.
      
      Adoption index is an essential parameter of an Agoran decision if
      that decision has an adoption index.
      
      For any Agoran decision with a non-"none" adoption index, the
      voting method is AI-majority.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2034/12 (Power=3)
Vote Protection and Cutoff for Challenges

      A public message purporting to resolve an Agoran decision is a
      self-ratifying attestation that
      
      1. such a decision existed,
      
      2. it had the number of voters indicated,
      
      3. it was resolved as indicated, and
      
      4. (if the indicated outcome was to adopt a proposal) such a
         proposal existed, was adopted, and, if it had not
         previously taken effect, took effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Offices & Reporting
   Players who hold offices have control over and track various
   different mechanics. These rules govern the special responsibilities
   that officers have.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1006/45 (Power=2)
Offices

      An Office is a position described as an Office by the Rules.
      Officeholder is an office switch tracked by the ADoP, with
      possible values of any person or "vacant" (default). An officer is
      the holder of an office, who may be referred to by the name of
      that office. If the holder of an office is ever not a player, it
      becomes vacant.
      
      An imposed office is an office described as such by the rule
      defining it. All others are elected. A person CANNOT be made the
      holder of an elected office without eir explicit or reasonably
      implied consent.
      
      The holder of an elected office CAN resign it by announcement,
      causing it to become vacant. The non-interim holder of an elected
      office CAN, with 3 support, resign the office while appointing
      another player to become the holder of the office, provided that
      other player is one of the Supporters. Any player CAN cause an
      office to become vacant without 2 objections.
      
      When a proposal takes effect and creates a new office, if the
      proposal does not specify otherwise, the author of that proposal
      becomes the holder of the office.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2630/1 (Power=2.0)
The Administrative State

      Each officer CAN, with 1.5 Agoran consent, enact, amend, or repeal
      eir own office's Administrative Regulations. If e has won an
      election for the office in the last 7 days, e CAN repeal them by
      announcement.  Administrative Regulations have the following
      properties:
      
      1. An officer SHALL NOT violate eir office's administrative
         regulations in the discharge of eir office.
      2. Any player CAN act on behalf of an officer to exercise eir
         official powers as authorized by eir office's administrative
         regulations.
      3. All players SHOULD abide by an officer's administrative
         regulations in matters relating to eir area of responsibility.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2651/0 (Power=2)
The Election Cycle

      A holder of an elected office who did not become its holder by
      winning an election, and has not won an election for that office
      since, is an interim holder. An elected office that is either
      vacant or has an interim holder is an interim office.
      
      An office is term-limited if the most recent election for that
      office was resolved more than the length of that office's term
      prior. The term for the office of Prime Minister is 90 days. The
      term for all other elected offices is 180 days.
      
      A player CAN initiate an election for a specified elected office:
      
      a) with 2 support, if either the office is interim or term-
      limited, and provided that the initiator becomes a candidate in
      the same message.
      
      b) By announcement, if e is the ADoP (or, if the office is the
      ADoP, if e is the Assessor) and the office is interim, or if e is
      the holder of that office.
      
      Once per quarter, the ADoP CAN and SHALL publish a Notice of
      Election specifying between 2-4 term-limited offices (if there
      fewer than 2 term-limited offices, the ADoP MUST instead list all
      of them).  Such a notice initiates elections for the specified
      offices.  The ADoP SHOULD prioritize offices that have gone
      longest since their last elections.
      
      The above notwithstanding, an election for an office CANNOT be
      initiated if one is already in progress.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2154/60 (Power=2)
Election Procedure

      When an election is initiated, it enters the nomination period,
      which lasts for 4 days. After an election is initiated and until
      nominations close, any player CAN become a candidate by
      announcement. A candidate ceases to be a candidate if e ceases to
      be a player during the election or if holding the office would
      make em Overpowered. During the nomination period, a candidate CAN
      cease to be a candidate by announcement if there is at least one
      other candidate.
      
      An election whose nomination period is complete is contested if it
      has two or more candidates, and uncontested otherwise. Nominations
      close at the end of the poll's voting period or when the election
      is ended, whichever comes first.
      
      After the nomination period ends, the ADoP (or, if the office is
      the ADoP, the Assessor) CAN and, in a timely fashion, SHALL:
      
      1) If the election is contested, initiate an Agoran decision to
         select the winner of the election (the poll). For this
         decision, the Vote Collector is the ADoP (or, if the office is
         the ADoP, the Assessor), the valid options are the candidates
         for that election (including those who become candidates after
         its initiation), and the voting method is instant runoff. When
         the poll is resolved, its outcome, if a player, wins the
         election. If the outcome is not a player, the election ends
         with no winner.
      
      2) If POSSIBLE per the following paragraph, end the election
         immediately.
      
      If at any point an uncontested election has a single candidate,
      then any player CAN by announcement declare em the winner of the
      election, thereby causing em to win the election. If at any point
      an uncontested election has no candidates, then any player CAN
      declare the election ended with no winner by announcement.
      
      When a player wins an election, e is installed into the associated
      office and the election ends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2573/2 (Power=2)
Impeachment

      Any player CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, expel (impeach) the holder
      of a specified elected office. When a person is impeached from an
      office, an election is immediately opened for that office. Players
      SHOULD NOT use this method of removal unless the officer has
      abused the powers of eir office or otherwise shown emself unworthy
      the trust of Agora.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2160/22 (Power=3)
Deputisation

      A player acting as emself (the deputy) CAN perform an action
      ordinarily reserved for an office-holder as if e held the office
      if
      
      1. the rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of
         holding that office, to perform the action (this requirement is
         fulfilled by the deputy performing the action);
      
      2. it would be POSSIBLE for the deputy to perform the action,
         other than by deputisation, if e held the office;
      
      3. either (i) a time limit by which the rules require the action
         to be performed has expired or (ii) the office is vacant;
      
      4. either (i) the office is vacant, (ii) the aforementioned time
         limit expired more than fourteen days ago, or (iii) the deputy
         announced between two and fourteen days earlier that e intended
         to deputise for that office for the purposes of the particular
         action; and
      
      5. the deputy, when performing the action, announces that e is
         doing so by deputisation or by temporary deputisation
      
      When a player deputises for an elected office, e becomes the
      holder of that office, unless the action being performed would
      already install someone into that office, and/or unless the
      deputisation is temporary.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2138/24 (Power=1)
The Associate Director of Personnel

      The Associate Director of Personnel (ADoP) is an office; its
      holder is responsible for keeping track of officers.
      
      The ADoP's report includes the following:
      
      1. The date of the last change (if any) to each office's
         Officeholder.
      2. The current status of the ongoing election for that office or,
         if there is no ongoing election for that office, the date on
         which the last election ended
      3. For filled elected offices, whether or not the holder is
         interim.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2472/5 (Power=2)
Office Incompatibilities

      Some pairs of office are incompatible:
      
      1. Prime Minister and Speaker
      
      2. Promotor and Assessor
      
      3. Assessor and ADoP
      
      4. Referee and Arbitor
      
      A player is Overpowered if e holds two offices which are
      incompatible with each other. Rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, a player CANNOT be installed into an office if
      doing so would make em Overpowered.
      
      If a player is Overpowered, any player CAN, with Notice, Demand
      Resignation from em. When this occurs, each office that the
      Overpowered player holds becomes vacant.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2143/33 (Power=1)
Official Reports and Duties

      For each person:
      
      1. If any task is defined by the rules as part of that person's
         weekly duties, then e SHALL perform it at least once each week.
         If any information is defined by the rules as part of that
         person's weekly report, then e SHALL maintain all such
         information, and the publication of all such information is
         part of eir weekly duties.
      
      2. If any task is defined by the rules as part of that person's
         monthly duties, then e SHALL perform it at least once each
         month. If any information is defined by the rules as part of
         that person's monthly report, then e SHALL maintain all such
         information, and the publication of all such information is
         part of eir monthly duties.
      
      Any information defined by the rules as part of a person's report,
      without specifying which one, is part of eir weekly report.
      Failure of a person to perform any duty required of em within the
      allotted time is the Class 2 Crime of Tardiness.
      
      An official duty for an office is any duty that the Rules
      specifically assign to that office's holder in particular
      (regardless of eir identity).
      
      An officer SHALL publish eir report in plain text, with tabular
      data lining up properly when viewed in a monospaced font.
      Publishing a report that deviates from these restrictions is the
      Class 2 Crime of Making My Eyes Bleed.
      
      Officers SHOULD maintain a publicly visible copy of their reports
      on the World Wide Web, and they SHOULD publish the address of this
      copy along with their published reports.
      
      A player CAN, by announcement, petition a specified officer to
      take a specified action; the officer SHALL publicly respond to
      the petition in a timely fashion.

Rule 2632/0 (Power=1.0)
Complexity

      Complexity is an office switch reflecting how complex it is to
      fulfill the duties of its office. Its possible values are all
      integers from 0 to 3 inclusive, where 1 is the default. It is
      tracked in the ADoP's weekly report. The ADoP CAN, with 2 Agoran
      consent, flip the complexity of an office.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2636/0 (Power=1.0)
The Ministor

      The Ministor is an office, tasked with overseeing gameplay
      related to Ministries. The Ministor SHALL publish eir monthly
      report in a timely manner from the beginning of the month.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2603/0 (Power=1)
Switch Responsiblity

      For each type of switch which would otherwise lack an officer to
      track it, and is not defined as untracked, there exists an imposed
      office named “Tracker of [switch name]” that is responsible for
      tracking that switch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2379/0 (Power=1)
No News Is Some News

      If the rules define a report as including a list, then while that
      list is empty, that report includes the fact that it is empty.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2616/0 (Power=1.0)
The Webmastor

      The Webmastor is an office.
      
      The Webmastor's monthly report includes a Directory, a Changelog,
      a Warning Log, and an Error Log. The Directory lists notable
      currently maintained public resources. The Changelog lists notable
      changes to resources. The Warning Log lists notable potential
      issues, such as inaccurate or aging resources or unintended issues
      with a public resource. The Error Log lists notable losses of
      resources - where a resource has become inaccessible,
      unmaintained, or unusable. Where 'notable' is used in this rule
      its meaning is up to the Webmastor's discretion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Documents
   Documents are little bits of text that can be ratified, therefore
   modifying the gamestate slightly.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1551/21 (Power=3.2)
Ratification

      When a document or statement (hereafter "document") is ratified,
      rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the gamestate is modified
      to what it would be if, at the time the ratified document was
      published, the gamestate had been minimally modified to make the
      ratified document as true and accurate as possible; however, if
      the document explicitly specifies a different past time as being
      the time the document was true, the specified time is used to
      determine the minimal modifications. Such a modification cannot
      add inconsistencies between the gamestate and the rules, and it
      cannot include rule changes unless the ratified document
      explicitly and unambiguously recites either the changes or the
      resulting properties of the rule(s). If no such modification is
      possible, or multiple substantially distinct possible
      modifications would be equally appropriate, the ratification
      fails.
      
      An internally inconsistent document generally cannot be ratified;
      however, if such a document can be divided into a summary section
      and a main section, where the only purpose of the summary section
      is to summarize information in the main section, and the main
      section is internally consistent, ratification of the document
      proceeds as if it contained only the main section.
      
      Text purportedly about previous instances of ratification (e.g. a
      report's date of last ratification) is excluded from ratification.
      The rules may define additional information that is considered to
      be part of the document for the purposes of ratification; such
      definitions are secured at a Power Threshold of 3.
      
      Ratification is secured with Power Threshold 3.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2202/9 (Power=3)
Ratification Without Objection

      A public document is part (possibly all) of a public message.
      
      A player CAN, without objection, ratify a specified public
      document.
      
      Ratification Without Objection CANNOT cause the repeal, amendment,
      enactment, or mutation of any Rule, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding.
      
      A player SHALL NOT knowingly use or announce intent to use
      Ratification Without Objection to ratify a (prior to ratification)
      document containing incorrect or Indeterminate information when a
      corrected document could be produced with reasonable effort,
      unless the general nature of the document's error and reason for
      ratifying it is clearly and plainly described in the announcement
      of intent. Such ratification or announcement of intent to ratify
      is the Class 8 Crime of Endorsing Forgery.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2201/10 (Power=3)
Self-Ratification

      When a public document is continuously undoubted for one week
      after publication:
      
      - If the rules define it as self-ratifying, it is ratified.
      
      - If the rules define it as a self-ratifying attestation to a
        given statement, the statement is ratified.
      
        This clause is inapplicable if the statement to be ratified
        cannot be reasonably ascertained from the ruleset and the
        contents of the message.
      
      Any person CAN by announcement issue a doubt (syn. claim of
      error), identifying a document and explaining the scope and nature
      of a perceived error in it (or in a statement it attests to).
      
      When this happens, the publisher of the original document SHALL
      (if e was required to publish that document) or SHOULD (otherwise)
      do one of the following in a timely fashion, in an announcement
      that clearly cites the claim of error:
      
         1. Deny the claim (causing it to cease to be a doubt).
      
         2. Publish a revision.
      
         3. Initiate an inquiry case regarding the truth of the claim
            (if the subject is actually a matter of law), or cite a
            relevant existing inquiry case.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Justice
   So you've broken a rule. Now what? This section describes Blots, the
   main method of punishment for Agorans.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2555/10 (Power=2)
Blots

      Blots are an indestructible fixed currency with ownership
      restricted to persons. A person with 1 or more blots is Impure, a
      person with 0 blots is Pure. An impure unregistered person is a
      Fugitive. The Referee is an office, and the recordkeepor for
      blots.
      
      To levy a fine of N on a person, where N is a positive integer or
      zero, is to grant em N blots. To expunge a blot is to destroy it.
      Levying fines and destroying blots are each secured with a Power
      Threshold of 1.7.
      
      A person CAN, by announcement, create a specified number of blots
      in eir possession.
      
      Any player CAN expunge a blot from a specified person (or emself
      if no one is specified) by paying a fee of one Blot-B-Gone.
      
      Any player CAN levy a fine of one blot on a specified person by
      paying a fee of two Blot-B-Gones, provided the specified person
      has not already gained two blots or more in the current week.
      
      At the beginning of each quarter, half (rounded down) of each
      fugitive's blots are destroyed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2556/1 (Power=3)
Penalties

      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, an impure person CANNOT win
      the game.
      
      The voting strength of a player on an Agoran decision is reduced
      by 1 for every 3 blots in eir possession.
      
      A player CAN, with 7 days notice, deregister (exile) a specified
      player (the outlaw) who has more than 40 blots.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2478/17 (Power=1.7)
Vigilante Justice

      A player CAN by announcement Point eir Finger at a player (the
      perp); the announcement is INEFFECTIVE if it does not explicitly
      name the perp, cite a specific rule or named crime, and specify an
      alleged violation of that rule or commission of that crime by that
      person.
      
      When a player Points a Finger, the investigator SHALL investigate
      the allegation and CAN, and in a timely fashion SHALL, conclude
      the investigation by:
      
      - Issuing a Warning to the perp, as described elsewhere;
      
      - Imposing the Cold Hand of Justice on the perp for the cited rule
        violation, as described elsewhere;
      
      - Issuing an Indictment against the perp for the cited rule
        violation, as described elsewhere; or
      
      - if e believes that no rules violation occurred or that it would
        be ILLEGAL or INEFFECTIVE to levy a fine for it, announcing the
        Finger Pointing to be Shenanigans.
      
      Initiating a Finger Pointing found to be Shenanigans is ILLEGAL
      and the Class 0+N Crime of Unjustified Gesticulation, where N is
      the number of times e has previously committed the crime in the
      current Agoran Week. The investigator of a finger pointing SHALL
      NOT point eir finger for the Crime of Unjustified Gesticulation
      with respect to that finger pointing.
      
      The above notwithstanding, the investigator CANNOT resolve a
      Finger Pointing for which e is the perp.
      
      The Referee is by default the investigator for all Finger
      Pointing. When the Referee's Finger is Pointed or the Referee is
      the perp, the Arbitor is the investigator.
      
      The Referee CANNOT Point eir Finger at the Arbitor, and the
      Arbitor CANNOT point eir finger at the Referee.
      
      A high crime is any crime specified as being class 4 or greater.
      The Referee CANNOT levy the Cold Hand of Justice to punish a high
      crime, the other provisions of this rule notwithstanding.
      
      The player who initiated the most Finger Pointings that resulted
      in a Warning, Indictment, or Cold Hand of Justice in the previous
      Agoran Week CAN once grant emself a Justice Card by announcement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2557/6 (Power=1.7)
Sentencing Guidelines

      When the rules authorize an investigator to impose the Cold Hand
      of Justice for a violation, e CAN do so by levying a fine of B on
      the perp by announcement, within the following guidelines:
      
      - B is at least 1 and at most twice the base value of the
        violation.
      
      - If the violation is described by the rules as a "Class N Crime"
        (where N is a positive integer, or an expression that evaluates
        to a positive integer), then N is the base value; otherwise the
        base value is 2.
      
      - The fine SHOULD be reduced to the degree that the violation is a
        minor, accidental, and/or inconsequential infraction.
      
      - The fine SHOULD be increased to the degree that the violation is
        willful, profitable, egregious, or an abuse of an official
        position.
      
      Optionally, in the same message in which e imposes justice, the
      investigator CAN specify that the violation is forgivable,
      specifying up to 10 words to be included in an apology.  If the
      investigator does so, the perp CAN, in a timely fashion, expunge P
      blots from emself, where P is the value of the fine, by publishing
      a formal apology of at least 200 words and including all the
      specified words, explaining eir error, shame, remorse, and ardent
      desire for self-improvement.
      
      When the rules authorize an investigator to issue a Warning for a
      violation, e CAN do so by announcement if the violation is
      described by the rules as a "Class N Crime" where N is 0 or an
      expression that evaluates to 0.
      
      When the rules authorize an investigator to issue an Indictment
      for a violation, e CAN do so by levying a fine on the perp, with
      1.5 Agoran Consent, provided that levying the fine would be
      otherwise LEGAL and EFFECTIVE.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2531/15 (Power=2)
Defendant's Rights

      Any attempt to levy a fine is INEFFECTIVE if it does not include
      value of the fine in blots, the name of the person being fined
      (the perp), and the specific reason for the fine.
      
      Any attempt to levy a fine pursuant to the imposition of the Cold
      Hand of Justice is INEFFECTIVE if:
      
        (1) it attempts to levy a fine on a person when that person
            can't be established by a preponderance of the evidence to
            have committed the action or inaction for which the fine was
            levied;
      
        (2) it attempts to levy a fine for an action or inaction which,
            at the time the inaction or action occurred, was not
            prohibited by the rules;
      
        (3) it attempts to levy a fine on a person for failure to take
            an action that e, through no fault of eir own, COULD NOT
            have performed;
      
        (4) it attempts to levy a fine on a person for conduct that e,
            through no fault of eir own, was obliged to undertake by a
            rule of equal or greater power to the one e violated;
      
        (5) it attempts to levy a fine on a person taking an action or
            inaction e could not have avoided when exercising the
            highest reasonably possible standard of care;
      
        (6) it attempts to levy a fine with a value that is blatantly
            and obviously unsuited to the conduct which constitutes the
            reason for its levy or to the person on whom it is being
            levied;
      
        (7) it attempts to levy a fine based upon the investigation of
            a Finger that had been Pointed more than 14 days after the
            action constituting the reason for the fine;
      
        (8) it attempts to levy a fine on a player for failing to take
            an action within the time period set by the Rules and that
            time period had expired more than 14 days prior to the
            Pointed Finger, if the fine is imposed based on an
            investigation of such Finger;
      
        (9) it attempts to levy a fine on a player who has already been
            fined for the conduct constituting the reason for the levy;
            or

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2617/2 (Power=1.0)
Defense Against the Dark Arts

      An action is forbidden if it would, upon its successful
      occurrence, cause Agora to be ossified or to cease to exist.
      
      Publicly attempting a forbidden action is PROHIBITED, and is the
      Class-4 Crime of Engaging in Forbidden Arts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Calls for Judgement
   What if there is a rule conflict? What if we can't decide what a rule
   means? Well then, it's time to call a CFJ.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 991/33 (Power=2)
Calls for Judgement

      Any person (the initiator) can initiate a Call for Judgement (CFJ,
      syn. Judicial Case), specifying a statement to be inquired into by
      announcement.
      
      When a person initiates a Call for Judgement, e CAN optionally bar
      one person from the case by announcement.
      
      At any time, each CFJ is either open (default), suspended, or
      assigned exactly one judgement that was validly assigned.
      
      The Arbitor is an office, responsible for the administration of
      justice in a manner that is fair for emself, if not for the rest
      of Agora.
      
      Judge is an untracked CFJ switch with possible values of any
      person or former person, or "unassigned" (default). To "assign" a
      CFJ to a person is to flip that CFJ's judge to that person.  To
      "remove" or "recuse" a person from a being the judge of a CFJ is
      to flip that CFJ's judge from that person to unassigned.
      
      When an open CFJ's judge is unassigned, the Arbitor CAN assign any
      eligible player to be its judge by announcement, and SHALL do so
      in a timely fashion after it becomes an open and unassigned CFJ.
      The players eligible to be assigned as judge are all active
      players except the initiator and the person barred (if any). The
      Arbitor SHALL assign judges over time such that all interested
      players have reasonably equal opportunities to judge.  If a CFJ
      has no judge assigned, then any player eligible to judge that CFJ
      CAN assign it to emself without 3 objections.
      
      The Arbitor's weekly report includes a summary of recent judicial
      case activity, including open and recently-judged cases, recent
      judicial assignments, and a list of players interested in judging.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 591/49 (Power=1.7)
Delivering Judgements

      When a CFJ is open and assigned to a judge, that judge CAN assign
      a valid judgement to it by announcement, and SHALL do so in a
      timely fashion after this becomes possible.
      
      The valid judgements for an inquiry case are as follows, based on
      the facts and legal situation at the time the inquiry case was
      initiated, not taking into account any events since that time:
      
      * FALSE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
        logically false.
      
      * TRUE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
        logically true.
      
      * IRRELEVANT, appropriate if the veracity of the statement is
        not relevant to the game or is an overly hypothetical
        extrapolation of the game or its rules to conditions that don't
        actually exist, or if it can be trivially determined from the
        outcome of another (possibly still undecided) judicial case that
        was not itself judged IRRELEVANT.
      
      * INSUFFICIENT, appropriate if the statement does not come
        with supporting arguments or evidence, and the judge feels as if
        an undue burden is being placed on em by the lack of arguments
        and evidence. A CFJ judged as INSUFFICIENT SHOULD be submitted
        again with sufficient arguments/evidence.
      
      * DISMISS, appropriate if the statement is malformed, undecidable,
        if insufficient information exists to make a judgement with
        reasonable effort, or the statement is otherwise not able to be
        answered with another valid judgement. DISMISS is not
        appropriate if PARADOXICAL is appropriate.
      
      * PARADOXICAL, appropriate if the statement is logically
        undecidable as a result of a paradox or or other irresovable
        logical situation. PARADOXICAL is not appropriate if IRRELEVANT
        is appropriate, nor is it appropriate if the undecidability
        arises from the case itself or in reference to it.
      
      If the judge of an open CFJ has not violated a time limit for
      assigning it a judgement, and has not previously filed a motion to
      either extend or reconsider the case, e CAN file a motion to
      extend the case by announcement. Doing so extends eir judgement
      deadline for that case by one week. In doing so, e SHOULD include
      a (nonbinding) draft or outline of eir current thoughts on the
      case.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 911/55 (Power=1.7)
Motions and Moots

      If a judgement has been in effect for less then seven days and has
      not been entered into Moot, then:
      
      - The judge of that CFJ CAN self-file a Motion to Reconsider the
        case by announcement, if e has not already self-filed a Motion
        to Reconsider that CFJ.
      - Any Player CAN group-file a Motion to Reconsider the case with 2
        support, if the CFJ has not had a Motion to Reconsider
        group-filed for it at any time while it has been assigned to its
        current judge.
      
      When a Motion to Reconsider is so filed, the case is rendered open
      again.
      
      If a CFJ has a judgement assigned, a player CAN enter that
      judgement into Moot with N+2 support, where N is the number of
      weeks since that judgement has been assigned, rounded down. When
      this occurs, the CFJ is suspended, and the Arbitor is once
      authorized to initiate the Agoran decision to determine public
      confidence in the judgement, which e SHALL do in a timely fashion.
      
      For this decision, the vote collector is the Arbitor and the valid
      options are AFFIRM, REMAND, and REMIT. When the decision is
      resolved, the effect depends on the outcome:
      
      - AFFIRM, FAILED QUORUM: The judgement is reassigned to the case,
        and cannot be entered into Moot again.
      
      - REMAND: The case becomes open again.
      
      - REMIT: The case becomes open again, and the current judge is
        recused. The Arbitor SHALL NOT assign em to the case again
        unless no other eligible judges have displayed interest in
        judging.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2175/9 (Power=1)
Judicial Retraction and Excess

      A new case is a judicial case that has not had any judge assigned
      to it. The initiator of a new case CAN retract it by announcement,
      thus causing it to cease to be a judicial case.
      
      An excess case is a new case whose initiator previously initiated
      five or more cases during the same week as that case. A person
      SHALL NOT initiate an excess case. The Arbitor CAN refuse an
      excess case by announcement, thus causing it to cease to be a
      judicial case. When e does so, e fulfills any obligations with
      regards to that case.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2492/6 (Power=1)
Recusal

      A judge CAN recuse emself from a CFJ e is assigned to by
      announcement.
      
      The Arbitor CAN recuse a judge from a case by announcement, if
      that judge has violated a time limit for judging the case and has
      not judged it in the mean time; the Arbitor SHALL do so in a
      timely fashion after the time limit expires, if able. The Arbitor
      CAN recuse an inactive or deregistered judge by announcement.
      
      If a judge is recused from a case that was continuously open and
      assigned to em for at least the past 4 days, e SHOULD NOT be
      assigned as a judge until e has apologised and/or reasonably
      explained eir actions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2246/6 (Power=2)
Submitting a CFJ to the Referee

      When a person initiates a Call for Judgement, e CAN, optionally,
      submit it to the Referee by announcement. All persons are
      ENCOURAGED to submit a case to the Referee only when there is a
      good reason not to let it be processed by the Arbitor as usual.
      
      When a CFJ is submitted to the Referee, the Referee receives all
      obligations and powers for the specific case that the Arbitor
      would otherwise receive due to being Arbitor.  This takes
      precedence over Rules that would otherwise assign duties and
      powers regarding a judicial case to the Arbitor.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Obligations & Contracts
   Agreements, promises, treaties, whatever you call them. This section
   contains rules which can bind players to obligations, in the form of
   Pledges and Contracts.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2471/1 (Power=1)
No Faking

      A person SHALL NOT make a public statement that is a lie. A
      statment is a lie if its publisher either knew or believed it to
      be not to be true at the time e published it (or, in the case of
      an action, not to be effective), and it was made with the intent
      to mislead. Merely quoting a statement does not constitute making
      it for the purposes of this rule. Any disclaimer, conditional
      clause, or other qualifier attached to a statement constitutes
      part of the statement for the purposes of this rule; the truth or
      falsity of the whole is what is significant.
      
      The previous provisions of this rule notwithstanding, a formal
      announcement of intent is never a lie.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2450/10 (Power=1.7)
Pledges

      If a consenting Player makes a clear public pledge (syn. Oath) to
      perform (or refrain from performing) certain actions, then
      breaking the pledge is ILLEGAL; doing so is the Class N crime of
      Oathbreaking, where N is the value explicitly stated by the
      pledge, or 2 if the pledge does not explicitly state a value.
      Allowing a pledge to expire without carrying out an action one
      pledged to do in it constitutes breaking the pledge.
      
      The time window of a pledge is W days, where W is the value
      explicitly stated by the pledge, or 60 if the pledge does not
      explicitly state a value. A pledge ceases to exist at the end of
      its time window.
      
      If breaking the pledge harms specific other parties, the Referee
      SHOULD solicit the opinion of those parties in determining an
      appropriate fine.
      
      The Notary CAN destroy a pledge Without Objection, but SHOULD NOT
      do so unless the pledge no longer serves any significant purpose.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2466/2 (Power=3)
Acting on Behalf

      When a rule allows one person (the agent) to act on behalf of
      another (the principal) to perform an action, that agent CAN
      perform the action if it is POSSIBLE for the principal to do so,
      taking into account any prerequisites for the action. If the
      enabling rule does not specify the mechanism by which the agent
      may do so, then the agent CAN perform the action in the same
      manner in which the principal CAN do so, with the additional
      requirement that the agent must, in the message in which the
      action is performed, uniquely identify the principal and that the
      action is being taken on behalf of that person.
      
      A person SHALL NOT act on behalf of another person if doing so
      causes the second person to violate the rules. A person CANNOT act
      on behalf of another person to do anything except perform a game
      action; in particular, a person CANNOT act on behalf of another
      person to send a message, only to perform specific actions that
      might be taken within a message, including actions that would
      otherwise be taken by publishing certain text.
      
      When an action is performed on behalf of a principal, then the
      action is considered for all game purposes to have been performed
      by the principal, unless a rule specifically states that it is
      treated differently for some purpose, in which case it is treated
      as described by that rule.
      
      Allowing a person to act on behalf of another person is secured at
      power 2.0. This rule takes precedence over any rule that would
      prohibit a person from taking an action, except that it defers to
      any rule that imposes limitations specifically on actions taken on
      behalf of another person.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2618/4 (Power=2.2)
Promises

      Promises are a class of assets, tracked by the Notary. Their
      essential attributes are their text and creator. A consenting
      player CAN, by announcement, grant a specified entity a promise,
      specifying its text and becoming its creator. A promise's owner is
      referred to as its bearer. Promises with the same text, creator,
      and bearer are fungible. Promises with the same text and creator
      SHOULD be referred to by the same title, but the title is not an
      essential attribute of the promise, just a way of referring to it.
      
      A promise's bearer CAN, by announcement, cash the promise,
      provided that any conditions for cashing it specified by its text
      are unambiguously met. By doing so, e acts on the creator of the
      promise's behalf, causing the creator to act as if e published the
      promise's text, and destroys the promise. However, to limit
      recursion, no promise can be cashed during the execution of
      another promise unless it existed before the execution of that
      promise began. The bearer SHOULD recite the promise's essential
      attributes in the same message e cashes it.
      
      In a promise's text, "the bearer" (or the like) refers to the
      promise's bearer, and "this promise" (or the like) refers to the
      promise. The text of the promise can refer to the context of the
      message in which it is cashed, but the context of the message does
      not otherwise change the meaning of the promise.
      
      The Library is an entity and CAN own promises. Any player CAN take
      a specified promise from the Library by announcement, provided e
      cashes the promise in the same message. The creator of a promise
      CAN take or revoke it from the Library by announcement, unless the
      promise's text unambiguously designates it as irrevocable. Any
      player CAN revoke a specified promise from the Library without
      objection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2519/2 (Power=3)
Consent

      A person is deemed to have consented to an action if and only if,
      at the time the action took place:
      
      1. e, acting as emself, has publicly stated that e agrees to the
         action and not subsequently publicly withdrawn eir statement;
      2. e is party to a contract whose body explicitly and
          unambiguously indicates eir consent;
      3. the action is taken as part of a promise which e created; or
      4. it is reasonably clear from context that e wanted the action to
         take place or assented to it taking place.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1742/23 (Power=2.5)
Contracts

      Any group of one or more consenting persons (the parties) may
      publicly make an agreement among themselves with the intention
      that it be binding upon them and be governed by the rules. Such
      an agreement is known as a contract. A contract may be modified,
      including by changing the set of parties, with the consent of all
      existing parties. A contract may also be terminated with the
      consent of all parties. A contract automatically terminates if the
      number of parties to it falls below one. It is IMPOSSIBLE for a
      person to become a party to a contract without eir consent.
      
      Parties to a contract governed by the rules SHALL act in
      accordance with that contract. This obligation is not impaired
      by contradiction between the contract and any other contract, or
      between the contract and the rules.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any change that would cause
      the full provisions or parties of a contract to become publicly
      unavailable is canceled and does not take effect.
      
      The portion of a contract's provisions that can be interpreted
      with reference only to information that is either publicly or
      generally available are known as its body; the remainder of the
      provisions are known as the annex.
      
      A party to a contract CAN perform any of the following actions as
      explicitly and unambiguously permitted by the contract's body:
      
      * Act on behalf of another party to the contract.
      
      * By announcement, revoke destructible assets from the contract.
      
      * By announcement, transfer liquid assets from the contract to a
        specified recipient.
      
      Any player CAN cause a contract to be terminated (syn. "shred")
      without 2 objections. This SHOULD only be done to remove unused
      contracts or contracts deemed detrimental to the game as a whole.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2608/3 (Power=2.0)
The Notary

      The Notary is an office.
      
      The Notary's weekly report contains:
      
      1. every pledge, along with its title, creator, time window, time
         of creation, and time of expiry;
      2. every contract, with its title, full provisions, and parties;
         and
      3. every promise, along with its title, text, creator, and bearer.
      
      If the Notary is required to report an entity's title, but none
      has been otherwise publicly provided, e CAN assign one by public
      designation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2631/2 (Power=1.0)
Charities

      Donation Level is a natural switch for contracts, tracked by the
      Notary, with a default of 0 and a maximum of 25. A contract with
      nonzero donation level is called a Charity.
      
      The Notary CAN flip a contract's donation level to a non-default
      value with 3 Agoran consent. This SHOULD only be done if the
      contract's provisions ensure that its funds received from Agora
      will be used solely for the betterment of Agora. Any player CAN
      flip a contract's donation level to 0 with Agoran consent.
      
      Whenever a payday occurs, half of each charity's coin holdings
      (rounded down) are destroyed, and then each charity gains a number
      of boatloads of coins equal to its donation level.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Assets
   Assets are things players can own. This section describes how that
   works.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2166/31 (Power=3)
Assets

      An asset is an entity defined as such by a document that has been
      granted Mint Authority by the Rules (hereafter the asset's backing
      document), and existing solely because its backing document
      defines its existence. An asset's backing document can generally
      specify when and how that asset is created, destroyed, and
      transferred.
      
      The rules collectively have Mint Authority. Contracts have Mint
      Authority. An asset defined by rule or regulation is public; any
      other asset is private.
      
      The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity (if any)
      defined as such by, and bound by, its backing document. That
      entity's report includes a list of all instances of that class and
      their owners. A public document purporting to be this portion of
      that entity's report is self-ratifying.
      
      For a class of assets to be "tracked by" an entity is for that
      entity to be its recordkeepor.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2576/3 (Power=3)
Ownership

      Each asset has exactly one owner.
      
      If ownership of an asset is restricted to a class of entities,
      then that asset CANNOT be gained by or transferred to an entity
      outside that class. By default, ownership of an asset is
      restricted to Agora, players, and contracts, but an asset's
      backing document may modify this.
      
      An asset "in abeyance" is one whose owner is nonexistent,
      indeterminate, or invalid. If an asset would otherwise be in
      abeyance, then it is owned by the Lost and Found Department (if
      possible) or destroyed (otherwise), subject to modification by its
      backing document (provided that the modification either destroys
      it or prevents it from being in abeyance). Rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the Lost and Found Department can own assets of
      every type. Assets owned by the Lost and Found Department can be
      transferred or destroyed by any player without objection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2577/6 (Power=3)
Asset Actions

      An asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner by announcement,
      subject to modification by its backing document. Attempts to
      destroy no assets are successful. An indestructible asset is one
      defined as such by its backing document, and CANNOT be destroyed
      except as explicitly specified by its backing document; any other
      asset is destructible.
      
      For an entity to gain (historical syn. earn) an asset is for that
      asset to be created in that entity's possession. To grant an
      entity an asset is to create it in eir possession.
      
      For an entity to lose an asset is for that asset to be destroyed
      from that entity's possession. To revoke an asset from an entity
      is to destroy it from that entity's possession.
      
      For entity A to take an asset from entity B is to transfer it from
      entity B to entity A.
      
      An asset generally CAN be transferred (syn. given) by announcement
      by its owner to another entity, subject to modification by its
      backing document. Attempts to transfer no assets are successful. A
      fixed asset is one defined as such by its backing document, and
      CANNOT be transferred; any other asset is liquid.
      
      When a rule indicates creating, destroying, or transferring an
      amount of assets that is not a natural number, the specified
      amount is rounded up to the nearest natural number after all other
      calculations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2578/1 (Power=3)
Currencies

      A currency is a class of asset defined as such by its backing
      document. Instances of a currency with the same owner are
      fungible.
      
      The "x balance of an entity", where x is a currency, is the number
      of x that entity possesses. Where it resolves ambiguity, the asset
      or currency being referred to is the currency designated as
      the official currency of Agora, if there is one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2579/3 (Power=3)
Fee-based Actions

      If the Rules associate payment of a set of assets (hereafter the
      fee for the action; syns: cost, price, charge) with performing an
      action, that method for performing that action is a fee-based
      method.
      
      If the fee is a non-integer quantity of a fungible asset, the
      actual fee is the next highest integer amount of that asset.
      
      To use a fee-based method, an entity (the Actor) who is otherwise
      permitted to perform the action must announce that e is performing
      the action; the announcement must specify the correct set of
      assets for the fee and indicate intent to pay that fee for the
      sole purpose of using that method to perform that action.
      
      Upon such an announcement:
      
        - If the Rules specify a recipient for the fee, and the Actor
          CAN transfer that specified fee from emself to the recipient,
          then that fee is transferred from the Actor to the recipient
          and the action is performed simultaneously;
      
        - If the Rules do not specify a recipient, and the Actor CAN
          destroy the specified fee in eir possession, then that fee in
          eir possession is destroyed and the action is performed
          simultaneously.
      
        - Otherwise, no changes are made to asset holdings and the
          action is not performed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Economics
   The economic landscape changes quickly in Agora. No matter what name
   we give to them, though, they all function similarly. This section
   only describes the core mechanics. Any other economic subsystems are
   described elsewhere.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2456/6 (Power=1)
The Treasuror

      The Treasuror is an office.
      
      The Treasuror's weekly report includes the list of all public
      classes of assets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2483/15 (Power=2)
Economics

      Coins are the official currency of Agora and are tracked by the
      Treasuror. They can be owned by players, contracts, and the Lost
      and Found Department.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2634/3 (Power=1.0)
Buoyancy Control

      The Total Buoyancy and Buoyancy Target are singleton integer
      switches, tracked by the Treasuror in eir weekly report.
      
      The Treasuror CAN, by announcement, set the Buoyancy Target to a
      specified value approximately equal to the sum of all coin
      balances at a specified point within the last week, and SHALL do
      so each time e publishes eir weekly report.
      
      The Treasuror may exercise reasonable judgement in calculating the
      Buoyancy Target. The Buoyancy Target will be deemed set so long as
      the value chosen by the Treasuror is not obviously and grossly
      incorrect. However, the Treasuror SHALL NOT deliberately introduce
      error into the Buoyancy Target.
      
      At the beginning of each month, the Total Buoyancy is flipped to
      the Buoyancy Target.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2635/3 (Power=1.0)
Floating Rate Fleet

      The Unit of Flotation is equal to 1/2500 times the Total Buoyancy,
      rounded up, and is tracked in the Treasuror's weekly report.  A
      boatload of something is a quantity of that thing equal in count
      to the Unit of Flotation.
      
      The Treasuror is ENCOURAGED to arrange for the new Total Buoyancy
      and Unit of Flotation to be published as close as possible to the
      beginning of the month.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2496/23 (Power=1)
Rewards

      Each time a player fulfills a reward condition, the officer
      associated with the condition CAN once by announcement, and SHALL
      in an officially timely fashion, grant the associated set of
      assets to the player.
      
      Below is a list of reward conditions and their associated assets
      and officers.
      
      * Being the author of an adopted sponsored proposal: a number of
        boatloads of coins equal to (the total number of valid ballots
        cast FOR the decision - the total number of valid ballots cast
        AGAINST) (Assessor).
      
      * Judging a CFJ that e was assigned to without violating a time
        limit to do so, unless at the time of judgement the case was
        open due to self-filing a motion to reconsider it: 5 boatloads
        of coins (Arbitor).
      
      * Publishing an office's weekly or monthly report, provided that
        publication was the first report published for that office in
        the relevant time period (week or month respectively) to fulfill
        an official weekly or monthly duty: 5 boatloads of coins times
        the complexity of the office (ADoP).
      
      * Resolving a referendum, provided that no other referendum had
        been resolved earlier in that Agoran week: 5 boatloads of coins
        times the Assessor's complexity (ADoP).
      
      * Having a Thesis pass peer-review and be granted a Degree based
        on its merit: 20 boatloads of coins (Herald)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2559/10 (Power=2)
Paydays

      Whenever a Payday occurs, each active player gains 10 boatloads of
      coins.
      
      At the beginning of each month, after all other events that take
      place at the beginning of the month, a Payday occurs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2620/2 (Power=1.0)
Cards & Sets

      Cards are a type of currency with a corresponding Product.
      Products are also currencies. The types of Cards and their
      corresponding Products are:
      
      * Win Cards and Winsomes.
      * Justice Cards and Blot-B-Gones
      * Legislative Cards and Pendants
      * Voting Cards and Votives
      
      A player CAN pay a 'set' of X Cards of the same type to gain Y
      corresponding Products. The value of X determines the value of Y
      in the following ways:
      
      * 1 Card = 1 Product
      * 2 Cards = 3 Products
      * 3 Cards = 6 Products
      * 4 Cards = 10 Products
      
      A player CANNOT pay more than 4 Cards as one 'set'.
      
      Cards and Products are tracked by the Treasuror.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2621/7 (Power=1.0)
VP Wins

      If a player has at least 20 more Winsomes than any other player, e
      CAN Take Over the Economy by announcement, provided no person has
      won the game by doing so in the past 30 days.
      
      When a player takes over the economy, e wins the game. Four days
      after such a win occurs, all Cards and all Products are destroyed.
      Then, the winds change, following which each active player gains 1
      card of each type and eir grant (if any).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2629/1 (Power=1.0)
Victory Auctions

      The Treasuror CAN conduct an auction (a "victory auction") if no
      victory auction is ongoing.  The Treasuror MUST do so at least
      once a month, and SHOULD do so at least twice each month.
      
      A victory auction includes the following lots:
      
      * one new Win Card.
      
      * all of any single type of card or product, currently owned by
        the Lost and Found Department, if any.
      
      The currency of a victory auction is coins (minimum bid 1).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2624/8 (Power=1.0)
Card Administration

      Each of the following Ministries has a Grant, listed below.
      
      Ministry of Compliance: 1 Justice Card
      Ministry of Legislation: 1 Legislative Card
      Ministry of Participation: 1 Voting Card
      Ministry of Legacy: 1 Winsome
      
      A player CAN once a month grant eir Ministry Focus' Grant to a
      specified player by announcement.
      
      The Ministor CAN, once a month and by announcement, and SHALL, in
      a timely manner from the beginning of the month, grant 1 Win Card
      to a random player whose Ministry Focus is Legacy .

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2638/1 (Power=2.0)
Player Focuses

      Ministry Focus (or just Focus) is a secured active player switch,
      tracked by the Ministor in eir monthly report, with possible values
      Unfocused (the default) and any Ministry.
      
      An active player CAN Plan to Flip eir own Ministry Focus,
      specifying any valid value for eir Ministry Focus, by
      announcement. When the rules state that the winds change, every
      active player's Ministry Focus is set to the value e mostly
      recently specified by Planning to Flip. If a player did not Plan
      to Flip eir Ministry Focus switch since the last time the winds
      changed, it is not flipped.
      
      The winds change at the beginning of each month.

Rule 2499/13 (Power=1)
Welcome Packages

      If a player has not received a Welcome Package since e most
      recently registered, any player CAN cause em to receive one by
      announcement.
      
      When a player receives a Welcome Package, e gains 10 boatloads of
      coins and one of each type of Card defined in the rules, unless e,
      or any person of whom e was a part or who was a part of em has
      received a welcome package in the last 30 days.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2585/6 (Power=1)
Birthday Gifts

      It is considered to be a player's Agoran Birthday on the
      anniversary of the day e first registered. If the day a player
      first registered is unknown, that player CAN, with Agoran consent,
      declare a day to be eir Agoran Birthday. As long as the day a
      player first registered remains unknown, it is considered to be
      eir Agoran Birthday on the anniversary of the day e most recently
      declared as eir Agoran Birthday.
      
      During a player's Agoran Birthday and the 7 days following, each
      other player CAN once grant em X boatloads of coins by
      announcement, where X is 3 if it is actually the day of the
      player's birthday, and 2 otherwise.
      
      Players are ENCOURAGED to announce their Agoran Birthdays.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2545/5 (Power=2)
Auctions

      An auction is a way for entities to give away specified assets
      (items), grouped into lots, in exchange for a currency. A lot is a
      non-empty list of items to be transferred to a single recipient
      (an auction winner).
      
      When the rules authorize a person (the auctioneer) to conduct an
      auction, e CAN do so by any wholly public method that would be
      generally recognizable, as specified by the auctioneer at the
      start of the auction, and under common definitions and terms used
      in auctions, as a fair, equitable, and timely means of determining
      the auction winners from among the current players, and enabling
      the appropriate exchange of goods. Persons who voluntarily
      participate in an auction (including the auctioneer) SHALL NOT
      violate requirements that auction's method that are clearly
      intended to be punishable as rules violations; doing so is the
      Class N Crime of Auction Manipulation, where N is the class
      specified in the auction method (or 2 otherwise).
      
      The rule that authorizes the auction further authorizes the
      auctioneer or auction winners to transfer said items as necessary
      to conduct the auction in a manner consistent with the auction
      method. If the authorization is to auction "new" items, it further
      authorizes the creation of said items as per the chosen method.
      The rule that authorizes the auction further authorizes the
      transfer or destruction of currency from persons who have bid
      voluntarily, as specified by the chosen auction method. The
      authorization to conduct the auction does not provide any further
      authorization than that explicitly described in this rule.
      
      The Treasuror is the promulgator for regulations that define
      specific auction methods (i.e. "the default auction method") and
      SHOULD do in order to aid trade and commerce.  For the purposes of
      interpreting auction definitions, such methods are treated as if
      they are defined in this rule. To further aid trade and commerce,
      auction methods should be interpreted in the name of fairness with
      deference to the method's clear intent, if intent can be
      reasonably inferred.

Stones
   A game in which people try to collect Stones with various different
   Magical Powers OooOooh!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2640/0 (Power=2)
Stones

      A stone is a unique indestructable liquid asset defined by the
      rules. To define a stone, the definition must include:
        (i) A name unique among stones;
       (ii) The escape risk of the stone, which must be a percentage between
            0% and 100% inclusive;
      (iii) A scroll, which is a document specifying the effects of the
            stone
       (iv) Optionally, a frequency, which must be one of daily, weekly,
            monthly, or quarterly.
      
      Ownership of stones is entirely restricted to Agora and active
      players.  If a stone is owned by the Lost and Found Department or
      in abeyance, it is immediately transferred to Agora.
      
      The Stonemason is an office, and the recordkeepor of stones.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2641/0 (Power=2)
Wielding Stones

      Except as otherwise specified by the rules, the owner of a stone
      CAN wield it by announcement specifying any values needed to
      interpret the stone's effects.
      
      If a stone has a frequency, then it is IMPOSSIBLE to wield that
      stone if it has been previously wielded in the same Agoran time
      interval as indicated by its frequency (e.g. if its frequency is
      daily, if it has been wielded in the same Agoran day).
      
      When a stone is wielded, the Rule defining that stone applies the
      effects in that stone's scroll.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2642/1 (Power=2)
Distributing Stones

      The Stonemason CAN initiate an auction for any set of stones
      belonging to Agora for which an auction is not ongoing, with each
      individual stone being an auction lot. The Stonemason is the
      auctioneer, and the currency is coins.
      
      The Stonemason SHALL if possible initiate such an auction monthly
      and only once a month, in a timely fashion after a collection
      notice has been issued. The Stonemason SHALL auction exactly 2
      stones in a month if possible

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2643/2 (Power=2)
Collecting Stones

      Once per month, the Stonemason CAN publish a collection notice by
      announcement, specifying all necessary information and choices.
      The Stonemason SHALL publish such a notice in a timely fashion
      after the beginning of each Agoran month.
      
      A stone is immune if it has been granted immunity, as defined by
      other rules, since the last collection notice or if it is
      currently owned by Agora.
      
      A collection notice includes zero or more random choices of
      whether each stone escapes. Each choice results in escape with
      probability equal to its escape risk; a stone escapes if any
      choice selects escape. When a collection notice is published,
      stones that escape are transferred to Agora in an order specified
      by the collection notice.
      
      If a stone is immune, there are zero escape choices; otherwise,
      there is one choice if the stone was used in the previous Agoran
      month, or two if it was not.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2644/5 (Power=2)
Zen Gardening

      A player CAN, by announcement, Notice the Rock Garden, specifying
      a single player that owns 8 or more stones, provided that no
      person has won the game by doing so in the past 30 days.
      
      When the Rock Garden is Noticed, the specified player wins the
      game.  If a player won the game in this manner 4 days ago, then
      all existing stones are transferred to Agora.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2645/5 (Power=2)
The Stones

      The following stones are defined, one per paragraph, with the
      following format: Stone Name (Frequency, Escape Risk): Scroll.

        wielder if not specified) hereby Buys Strength 3 times.
      
      - Wealth Stone (weekly, 50%): A specified player (defaulting to
        the wielder if not specified) hereby gains 5 boatloads of coins.
      
      - Soul Stone (weekly, 50%): The Soul Stone is hereby transferred
        to the owner of a different specified non-immune stone, then
        that stone is transferred to the wielder.
      
      - Sabotage Stone (weekly, 80%): The adoption index of a specified
        AI-majority Agoran decision is hereby increased by 1.
      
      - Concentration Stone (monthly, 60%): A specified player
        (defaulting to the wielder if not specified) gains the Grant
        associated with eir Focus.

        immunity.
      
      - Recursion Stone (Monthly, 80%): The recursion stone can be
        wielded once per month as if it had the power of any other stone
        of your choice.
      
      - Hot Potato Stone (Weekly, 100%):  When this stone is wielded,
        the wielder gains 8 boatloads of coins if the wielder, in the
        same message as the wielding, transfers this stone to a player
        who has not owned this stone since Agora last owned it. This
        stone cannot otherwise be transferred, other rules
        notwithstanding. This stone is immune if 3 or more players have
        wielded it since the most recent collection notice.
      
      - Blank Stone (Monthly, 5%): This stone has no effect.
      
      - Alchemy Stone (weekly, 70%): Destroy four cards you own. If four
        cards were destroyed this way, gain 7 products of your choice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2655/2 (Power=1)
The Mad Engineer

      The Mad Engineer is an office; its holder is responsible for
      building, tracking, and maintaining the Device.  The device is a
      singleton switch with values off (default) and on.  The Mad
      Engineer CAN flip the device to either on or off with Agoran
      Consent; any other player CAN do so with 2 Agoran Consent.
      
      The Mad Engineer CAN act on behalf of the device to take any
      action that the device may take, and SHALL act on behalf of the
      device to ensure that the device fulfills all of its duties.
      
      The Mad Engineer's weekly duties include the performance of the
      following tasks, in order:
      
      a) Randomly select exactly one rule.  If the selected rule is
      either this rule or the rule "The Device", then 007 has been
      spotted near the self-destruct button; skip directly to announcing
      intent, below.
      
      b) Select one or more contiguous sentences from the selected rule.
      
      c) Select exactly one noun from the selected text, and replace
      each instance of that noun with "Device" (including grammatical
      variations, e.g. replacing "<noun>'s" with "Device's").
      
      d) Announce intent to, with Agoran Consent, cause this rule to
      amend the rule "The Device" by inserting the modified text as the
      last list item in either the "device on" or "device off" lists in
      that rule (or, if 007 has been spotted, to repeal both that rule
      and this one).
      
      If the announcement of intent above is made with the procedure
      described above, the Mad Engineer CAN, with Agoran Consent, cause
      this rule to amend the rule "The Device" as indicated (or, if 007
      has been spotted, cause this rule to repeal both that rule and
      this one), and SHALL do so if the intent receives sufficient
      support.

Scoring
   A game in which players attempt attempt to amass points, in order to
   (presumably) become the Pointiest.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2656/0 (Power=1.5)
Points

      A player's Score, indicated in Points, is an integer player switch
      defaulting to 0, tracked by the Herald.
      
      Upon a correct announcement from a player that one or more players
      have a score of 100+ points, all players meeting this condition
      win the game.  If a least one player wins the game via such an
      announcement, all players' scores are set to their default.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2657/0 (Power=1)
Scoring

      Each time a player fulfills a scoring condition, the officer
      associated with the condition CAN once by announcement, and SHALL
      in an officially timely fashion, add to that player's score the
      associated amount of points.
      
      Below is a list of scoring conditions and their associated points
      and officers.
      
        * Being the author of a sponsored proposal that takes effect:
          1 + the power of the proposal when it takes effect (Assessor).
      
        * Being the coauthor of a sponsored proposal that takes effect:
          1 (Assessor).
      
        * Having submitted an unconditional ballot AGAINST a referendum
          on a sponsored proposal, provided that the ballot is valid at
          the time the referendum is assessed, and provided that the
          outcome of that assessment is ADOPTED:  points equal to the
          voting player's voting strength on the referendum (Assessor).

Victory
   All games have winners, and Agora is no exception. If you're
   interested in getting some serious bragging points among the Agorans,
   this is the right place to look.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2449/3 (Power=3)
Winning the Game

      When the Rules state that a person or persons win the game, those
      persons win the game; specifically they win the Round that ends
      with the indicated win. Agora itself does not end and the ruleset
      remains unchanged. The Herald is then authorized to award those
      persons the Patent Title of Champion once, by announcement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2465/1 (Power=0.3)
Victory by Apathy

      A player CAN Declare Apathy without objection, specifying a set of
      players. Upon doing so, the specified players win the game, except
      for those who have won the game through this Rule in the past 14
      days.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2553/4 (Power=1)
Win by Paradox

      If a CFJ about the effectiveness, possibility, or legality of a
      change in the gamestate has been assigned a judgment of
      PARADOXICAL continuously for between 7 and 90 days, then that
      case's initiator, CAN, by announcement, Transcend Logic,
      specifying that CFJ, provided that e has not already won the game
      with respect to that CFJ. When a person transcends logic, e wins
      the game.
      
      A player who wins in this fashion SHOULD submit a proposal to
      prevent the paradox from arising again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Awards
   Even if it's not a win, there are still a good few opportunities to
   win bragging points, like Ribbons and Patent Titles.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2438/25 (Power=3)
Ribbons

      The Tailor is an office, and the recordkeepor of Ribbons.
      
      For each type of Ribbon, <type> Ribbon Ownership is a secured
      negative boolean person switch, tracked by the Tailor in eir
      monthly report. Laudability is a secured person switch with
      non-negative integer possible values, defaulting to 0, tracked by
      the Tailor as part of eir monthly report. When a person owns more
      types of ribbons than eir Laudability, eir Laudability is set to
      the number of types of ribbons e owns.
      
      To "award a person a <Ribbon type>" is to flip that person's
      <that type> Ribbon Ownership to True. A person "owns a <Ribbon
      type>" if eir <that type> Ribbon Ownership is True.
      
      A person qualifies for a type of Ribbon if e has earned that type
      of Ribbon within the preceding 7 days (including earlier in the
      same message).
      
      While a person owns all types of Ribbon, that person can Raise a
      Banner by announcement. This causes that person to win the game.
      When a person wins this way, for each type of Ribbon, that
      person's <type> Ribbon Ownership is flipped to False.
      
      The types of Ribbon, and the methods of obtaining them, are as
      follows:
      
      Red (R): When a proposal is adopted and changes at least one rule
      that, immediately before or after the change, has Power >= 3, its
      proposer earns a Red Ribbon.
      
      Orange (O): When a proposal is adopted via a referendum on which
      no valid ballots were AGAINST (after evaluating conditionals), its
      proposer earns an Orange Ribbon.
      
      Green (G): While a person holds an elected office, has done so
      continuously for the past 30 days, and has not failed to perform
      any duties of that office within the appropriate time limits
      during those 30 days, that person qualifies for a Green Ribbon.
      
      Emerald (E): When a person wins an election, e earns an Emerald
      Ribbon.
      
      Cyan (C): When a person deputises for an office, that person earns
      a Cyan Ribbon.
      
      Blue (B): When a person assigns a judgement to a CFJ, and has
      never violated a time limit to assign a judgement to that CFJ,
      nor ever self-filed a motion to reconsider that CFJ, that person
      earns a Blue Ribbon.
      
      Magenta (M): When, during Agora's Birthday, a person publicly
      acknowledges it, that person earns a Magenta Ribbon.
      
      Ultraviolet (U): When a person is awarded the Patent Title
      Champion, that person earns an Ultraviolet Ribbon, unless the
      Champion title was awarded as the result of winning the game via
      this rule.
      
      Violet (V): When a person is awarded a Patent Title other than
      Champion or a degree, that person earns a Violet Ribbon.
      
      Indigo (I): When a person is awarded a degree, that person earns
      an Indigo Ribbon.
      
      Platinum (P): The Speaker qualifies for a Platinum Ribbon.
      
      Lime (L): A person qualifies for a Lime Ribbon if three or more
      proposals adopted in the preceding 7 days had that person as a
      coauthor.
      
      White (W): A player qualifies for a White Ribbon if e has never
      previously owned a White Ribbon (including under previous
      rulesets). A player who has been registered for at least 30 days
      and has never acted on eir own behalf to cause another person to
      gain a White Ribbon (including under a previous ruleset) CAN act
      on eir own behalf to award a White Ribbon to another person by
      announcement.
      
      Black (K): An instrument CAN, as part of its effect, cause a
      person to earn a Black Ribbon. When this occurs, this Rule awards
      that person a Black Ribbon.
      
      Gray (A): The Tailor CAN award a Gray Ribbon by announcement,
      unless e has done so earlier in the month. E is ENCOURAGED to
      award such a Ribbon in the same message in which e publishes eir
      monthly report.
      
      Transparent (T): A person qualifies for a Transparent Ribbon while
      the number of other types of Ribbon that that person qualifies
      for, earns, and/or was awarded within the previous 7 days is at
      least 5.
      
      While a person qualifies for a type of Ribbon:
      
        - If e has not owned that type of Ribbon within the preceding 7
          days, any player CAN, by announcement, award em that type of
          Ribbon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2602/7 (Power=1)
Glitter

      "Each type of Ribbon has a corresponding type of Glitter with the
      same name. A player qualifies for a type of Glitter when e
      qualifies for the same type of Ribbon while already owning such a
      Ribbon. If a player has not been awarded that type of Ribbon or e
      corresponding type of Glitter since e last earned or came to
      qualify for that type of Ribbon, and has not been so awarded five
      or more times within the past 24 hours, any player CAN award em
      that type of Glitter by announcement. When a player gains a type
      of Glitter, the Tailor SHALL in an officially timely fashion and
      CAN once by announcement award em N/2 boatloads of coins rounded
      up, where N is the number of players that did not own the
      corresponding type of Ribbon at the time of the award. The amount
      payable for each type of Glitter is tracked in the Tailor's weekly
      report.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2480/5 (Power=3.1)
Festivals

      Festivity is a secured singleton switch, whose possible values are
      integers ranging from 0 inclusive to the number of defined types
      of Ribbon exclusive, and defaulting to 0. While Agora's Festivity
      is 0, Festivity is tracked in the Tailor's monthly report.
      Otherwise, it is tracked in the Tailor's weekly report.
      
      If Agora's Festivity has had the same nonzero value for 14 days or
      more, or if it has a nonzero value and fewer than 5 players are
      Festive, then any player CAN flip it to 0 by announcement.
      
      A person whose Laudability is greater than or equal to Agora's
      Festivity is Festive. Any other person is not Festive.
      
      A player who would be Festive if the Festivity was N CAN Start a
      Rank N Festival, where N is an integer greater than Agora's
      Festivity, with 4 support from other players who would be Festive
      if the Festivity was N, except that a Rank N Festival CANNOT be
      started if Agora's Festivity has had a value grater than or equal
      to N in the past 21 days. Upon a Rank N Festival starting, Agora's
      Festivity is flipped to N.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2481/5 (Power=3.1)
Festival Restrictions

      While Agora's Festivity is nonzero, the following apply:
      
      1. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, non-Festive players
         CANNOT support/be a supporter for tabled action intents;
      
      2. Quorum for Agoran Decisions is equal to half the number of

Rule 649/44 (Power=1.5)
Patent Titles

      A Patent Title is a legal title held by an entity in recognition
      of eir distinction. The Herald is an office; its holder is
      responsible for tracking Patent Titles in eir monthly report.
      
      Awarding or revoking a Patent Title is secured at power 1. A
      person permitted and enabled to award (revoke) a Patent Title
      SHALL do so in a timely fashion after the conditions authorizing
      em to do so are announced, unless there is an open judicial case
      contesting the validity of those conditions.
      
      The Herald CAN award a specified Patent Title to a specified
      player with 2 Agoran consent. Any player CAN award a specified
      Patent Title to a specified player, as authorized by the Herald's
      Administrative Regulations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2415/1 (Power=1.5)
Badges

      A Badge is any patent title with the word 'badge' as part of its
      name. A badge SHOULD be used to award multiple persons for
      participating in specific event of note within Agora.  Any player
      CAN award a badge that does not yet exist to three or more persons
      simultaneously, with Agoran consent. The Herald CAN award an
      existing badge to persons without objection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1367/26 (Power=2)
Degrees

      Certain patent titles are known as degrees. The degrees are
      
      - Associate of Nomic Art             (A.N.A.)
      - Associate of Nomic                 (A.N.)
      - Juris Doctorate of Nomic           (J.N.)
      - Baccalaureate of Nomic Art         (B.N.A.)
      - Baccalaureate of Nomic             (B.N.)
      - Magisteriate of Nomic Art          (M.N.A.)
      - Magisteriate of Nomic              (M.N.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic Art             (D.N.Art.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic History         (D.N.Hist.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic Law             (D.N.Law.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic Science         (D.N.Sci.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic Philosophy      (D.N.Phil.)
      
      There are four classes of degrees, ranked in ascending order of
      merit: Associate degrees (A.N.A. and A.N.), Baccalaureate degrees
      (J.N through B.N.), Magisteriate degrees (M.N.A and M.N), and
      Doctorate degrees (D.N.Art. through D.N.Phil.).
      
      A specified degree CAN be awarded by any player other than the
      awardee, with 2 Agoran consent. It SHOULD only be awarded for the
      publication of an original thesis of scholarly worth (including
      responses to peer-review), published with explicit intent to
      qualify for a degree. The Herald SHOULD coordinate the peer-review
      process and the awarding of degrees.
      
      Degrees SHOULD be awarded according to the extent to which the
      thesis contributes to Nomic culture or thought: Associate degrees
      for an appreciable contribution, Baccalaureate degrees for a
      substantial contribution, Magisteriate degrees for a remarkable
      contribution, and Doctorate degrees for an exceptional
      contribution. Any degree at the Doctorate level SHOULD take into
      account the awardee's academic history and participation in Agora
      over time.
      
      Theses for Art degrees SHOULD demonstrate substantial creativity
      and need not be in written form. Theses for all other degrees
      SHOULD demonstrate substantial research or analysis. J.N.  and
      D.N.Law are appropriate for high-quality legal analysis, of the
      sort typical to CFJs, but exceeding an ordinary CFJ in depth.  The
      D.N.Hist. degree is appropriate for historical research,
      especially when it presents a narrative that educates Agorans
      about the events of the past. The D.N.Sci. degree is appropriate
      for theses that demonstrate concrete or scientific thinking,
      whereas the D.N.Phil. is appropriate for theses that demonstrate
      abstract or philosophical thinking.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2231/7 (Power=3)
Order of the Hero of Agora Nomic

      Heroic titles are Agora's premier patent titles of distinction,
      and CAN be awarded to persons for meritorious service only by a
      proposal of power 3 or greater, which SHOULD explain why those
      persons are qualified. Bearers of heroic titles (Heroes)
      constitute the Order of the Hero of Agora Nomic.

      right good forever.
      
      Hero of Agora Nomic (HAN) -- This title may be awarded to any
      person for outstanding meritorious service to Agora above and
      beyond the call of duty.

========================================================================
Leaders
   Agora has a good few leaders, most of which are nothing more than
   sinecures. This section isn't all that important.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 103/29 (Power=2)
The Speaker

      The Speaker is an imposed office and the figurehead leader of
      Agora. The player or players who have most recently won the game
      are called Laureled. If at any time the office of Speaker is
      vacant, or when one or more players win Agora, then the Prime
      Minister CAN once appoint a Laureled player to the office of
      Speaker by announcement.
      
      Whenever the Prime Minister CAN appoint a Laureled player to the
      office of Speaker, e SHALL do so in a timely manner, except that
      the Prime Minister MAY defer appointing a new Speaker while there
      is pending one or more open CFJs that could plausibly determine or
      affect the question of whether a player is Laureled.  If the Prime
      Minister is emself Laureled, eir power to appoint a Speaker
      continues for the entirety of a message in which e resigns as
      Prime Minister, and if e is the only Laureled player, e CAN void
      that power, and thereby discharge the obligation to use it, by
      announcing that e declines to take the office.
      
      If the office of Speaker has been held continuously by the same
      person for 90+ days, then any player CAN appoint another player to
      the office with support.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 104/0 (Power=3)
First Speaker

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2423/5 (Power=2)
First Among Equals

      The Prime Minister is an office. The Prime Minister is elected by
      the players of Agora primarily on account of not being the other
      guy. The Prime Minister SHOULD ensure that Agoran affairs proceed
      smoothly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2463/3 (Power=1)
Motion of No Confidence

      Any player can cause the office of Prime Minister to become vacant
      with Agoran consent by publishing a message with the character
      string "MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE" in the subject line. Motions of
      confidence SHOULD used whenever Agorans want to shake things up,
      rather than as a personal judgement of the Prime Minister.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2451/8 (Power=2)
Executive Orders

      Once per week, except as otherwise forbidden by this rule, the
      current Prime Minister CAN issue a Cabinet Order by announcement
      to perform the action(s) authorized by that Order.
      
      Each Cabinet Order is associated with an office. The current Prime
      Minister CANNOT issue more than one Cabinet Order associated with
      the same office more than once in the same month, nor can e issue
      a Cabinet Order associated with a vacant office.
      
      The available Cabinet Orders are:
      
      - Certiorari (Arbitor): The Prime Minister assigns emself as judge
        of a specified open case.
      
      - Dive (Referee): The Prime Minister levies a fine of 2 on a
        specified player. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the
        reason for the fine MAY be any grievance held by the Prime
        Minister, not necessarily a violation of the rules, against the
        person to whom the fine is levied.
      
      - Manifesto (Promotor): The Prime Minister distributes a specified
        proposal in the Proposal Pool.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2575/3 (Power=3)
The Distributor

      The Distributor is an imposed office whose holder is generally
      responsible for the management of the primary Agoran fora. The
      holder CANNOT be changed except without objection or by proposal.
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the Distributor CANNOT
      deregister or be deregistered.

Agoran Culture
   Nothing in here is all that important. Mostly describes holidays and
   tournaments, and joke rules.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2327/3 (Power=1)
Read the Ruleset Week

      The first Agoran week each year which falls entirely in February
      is Read the Ruleset Week. Agorans are encouraged to read the
      ruleset during Read the Ruleset Week.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1727/21 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;
      
      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial Rulesets
      of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets of Nomic
      World and other nomics,
      
      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June 30,
      1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by FIRST SPEAKER
      Michael Norrish, which read, in part,
      
        "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
        precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think we may
        as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules are invited.
        In accordance with the rules, these will be published, numbered
        and distributed by me at my earliest convenience."
      
      And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic,
      known unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was played
      on, until its Players, much later, gave it its OFFICIAL NAME of
      Agora,
      
      And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest, and
      most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the hard work
      and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent advice of
      Agoraphobes,
      
      And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
      founding,
      
      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2464/6 (Power=1)
Tournaments

      A Tournament is a sub-game of Agora specifically sanctioned to be
      initiated as a tournament by the Rules. The person who initiates a
      tournament is its Gamemaster. Each time that one or more winners
      of a tournament are determined before it concludes, that person or
      those persons win the game. A tournament concludes when its
      regulations state that it concludes. Additionally, if it has not
      previously concluded, a tournament concludes 3 months after its
      initiation.
      
      A Tournament is governed by set of regulations, created in
      accordance with its parent rule, which have binding control over
      those who freely consent to play the tournament and over the
      tournament itself. Once the tournament is concluded, these
      regulations cease to have any effect, and CAN be repealed by any
      player by announcement. A Tournament's regulations collectively
      have Mint Authority.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2566/2 (Power=1)
Free Tournaments

      A player who is not the gamemaster of an existing tournament CAN
      initiate a sanctioned tournament with a specified set of
      regulations with 2 Agoran consent. A tournament created using this
      method is called a Free Tournament.
      
      A free tournament CAN be concluded with no winner without 3
      objections. Tournaments SHOULD only be concluded in this manner if
      it is clear that its regulations are malformed or contrary to the
      tournament's intent or that it is IMPOSSIBLE for any player to win
      the tournament.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2495/2 (Power=1)
The Birthday Tournament

      In a timely fashion after the start of June 1 of each year, the
      Herald SHALL propose a set of Regulations governing a Birthday
      Tournament for that year; the Herald CAN also delegate the
      responsibility for creating or running the tournament to another
      player, with that player's consent, by announcement.
      
      The Birthday Tournament's regulations SHOULD be such that all
      persons who choose to participate have a fair chance of winning
      the tournament (according to its regulations), and a winner
      SHOULD be expected within 2-3 weeks following the tournament's
      initiation.
      
      After adequate time for discussion of the Birthday Tournament's
      regulations, the Herald (or delegate) CAN initiate a sanctioned
      tournament, promulgating a specified, finalized set of tournament
      regulations, without 3 objections. This title may thereafter
      be amended only by the Herald or eir designee Without 3
      Objections. The initiation SHOULD be timed to coincide
      with Agora's Birthday.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1769/15 (Power=3)
Holidays

      The period each year from midnight GMT on the morning of 24
      December to the beginning of the first Agoran week to begin after
      2 January is a Holiday.
      
      The week that contains the beginning of Agora's Birthday,
      together with the following week, is a Holiday.
      
      If a person breaks a Rule by missing a deadline that occurs during
      a Holiday, punishment is generally not appropriate.
