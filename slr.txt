The Game of Agora
   This section includes a few rules concerning the Nature of the Game
   of Agora.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 101/17 (Power=4)
The Game of Agora

      Agora is a game of Nomic, wherein Persons, acting in accordance
      with the Rules, communicate their game Actions and/or results of
      these actions via Fora in order to play the game. The game may be
      won, but the game never ends.
      
      Please treat Agora Right Good Forever.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1698/5 (Power=4)
Agora Is A Nomic

      Agora is ossified if it is IMPOSSIBLE for any reasonable
      combination of actions by players to cause arbitrary rule changes
      to be made and/or arbitrary proposals to be adopted within a
      four-week period.
      
      If, but for this rule, the net effect of a proposal would cause
      Agora to become ossified, or would cause Agora to cease to exist,
      it cannot take effect, rules to the contrary notwithstanding. If
      any other single change or inseperable group of changes to the
      gamestate would cause Agora to become ossified, or would cause
      Agora to cease to exist, it is cancelled and does not occur, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Players
   This small section provides some rules detailing how joining and
   leaving Agora works. If you're a new player, this is probably the
   most important section to read.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 869/45 (Power=3)
How to Join and Leave Agora

      Any organism that is generally capable of freely originating and
      communicating independent thoughts and ideas is a person. Rules to
      the contrary notwithstanding, no other entities are persons.
      
      Citizenship is a person switch with values Unregistered (default)
      and Registered, tracked by the Registrar. Changes to citizenship
      are secured. A registered person is a Player. To "register"
      someone is to flip that person's Citizenship switch from
      Unregistered to Registered.
      
      An Unregistered person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or
      prevented by the rules) register by publishing a message that
      indicates reasonably clearly and reasonably unambiguously that e
      intends to become a player at that time. A player, acting as
      emself, CAN deregister (cease being a player) by announcement. If
      e does so, e CANNOT register or be registered for 30 days.
      
      A person, by registering, agrees to abide by the Rules. The Rules
      CANNOT otherwise bind a person to abide by any agreement without
      that person's willful consent.
      
      The Rules CANNOT compel non-players to act without their express
      or reasonably implied consent. The rules CANNOT compel players to
      unduly harass non-players. A non-person CANNOT be a player, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 478/34 (Power=3)
Fora

      Freedom of speech being essential for the healthy functioning of
      any non-Imperial nomic, it is hereby resolved that no Player shall
      be prohibited from participating in the Fora, nor shall any person
      create physical or technological obstacles that unduly favor some
      players' fora access over others.
      
      Publicity is a forum switch with values Public, Discussion, and
      Foreign (default), tracked by the Registrar. Changes to publicity
      are secured.
      
      The Registrar may change the publicity of a forum without
      objection as long as:
      
      1. e sends eir announcement of intent to that forum; and
      
      2. if the forum is to be made public, the announcement by which
         the Registrar makes that forum public is sent to all existing
         public fora.
      
      Each player should ensure e can receive messages via each public
      forum.
      
      A public message is a message sent via a public forum, or sent to
      all players and containing a clear designation of intent to be
      public. A rule can also designate that a part of one public
      message is considered a public message in its own right. A person
      "publishes" or "announces" something by sending a public message.
      
      Where the rules define an action that CAN be performed "by
      announcement", a person performs that action by unambiguously and
      clearly specifying the action and announcing that e performs it.
      Any action performed by sending a message is performed at the time
      date-stamped on that message. Actions in messages (including
      sub-messages) are performed in the order they appear in the
      message, unless otherwise specified.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2139/13 (Power=2)
The Registrar

      The Registrar is an office; its holder is responsible for keeping
      track of players.
      
      The Registrar's weekly report includes:
      
      1. A list of all players, including information sufficient to
         identify and contact each player.
      
      2. The date on which each player most recently became a player.
      
      3. For each forum with non-Foreign publicity, sufficient
         instructions for players to receive messages there.
      
      The Registrar's monthly report includes:
      
      1. For each former player for which the information is reasonably
         available, the dates on which e registered and deregistered.
      
      The Registrar's duties and abilities also include:
      
      * Changing the publicity of a forum, as described in Rule 478.
      
      * Publishing Cantus Cygnei and Writs of FAGE as described in
        Rule 1789.
      
      The Registrar is also responsible for tracking any switches,
      defined in a rule, that would otherwise lack an officer to track
      them, unless the switch is defined as untracked.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1789/9 (Power=3)
Cantus Cygneus

      Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously by
      the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part of
      it, e may submit a document to the Registrar, clearly labeled a
      Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and expressing eir
      reproach for those who e feels have treated em so badly.
      
      In a timely fashion after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the
      Registrar shall publish this document along with a Writ of
      Fugiendae Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione, commanding the Player
      to be deregistered. The Registrar shall note the method of
      deregistration for that Player in subsequent Registrar Reports.
      
      The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and the
      notation in the Registrar's Report will ensure that, henceforth,
      all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of FAGE.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
General Definitions
   This section describes the terminology used by all the other rules.
   If, when reading a rule, you don't understand what a word means,
   chances are that the Agoran definition of that word is described in
   one of these rules.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2152/7 (Power=3)
Mother, May I?

      The following terms are defined. These definitions are used when a
      rule includes a term in all caps, and provide guidance in
      determining the ordinary-language meaning of a term when a rule
      includes a term otherwise. Earlier definitions take precedence
      over later ones. If a rule specifies one or more persons in
      connection with a term, then the term applies only to the
      specified person(s).
      
      1. CANNOT, IMPOSSIBLE, INEFFECTIVE, INVALID: Attempts to perform
         the described action are unsuccessful.
      
      2. MUST NOT, MAY NOT, SHALL NOT, ILLEGAL, PROHIBITED: Performing
         the described action violates the rule in question.
      
      3. NEED NOT, OPTIONAL: Failing to perform the described action
         does not violate the rules.
      
      4. SHOULD NOT, DISCOURAGED, DEPRECATED: Before performing the
         described action, the full implications of performing it should
         be understood and carefully weighed.
      
      5. CAN: Attempts to perform the described action are successful.
      
      6. MAY: Performing the described action does not violate the
         rules.
      
      7. MUST, SHALL, REQUIRED, MANDATORY: Failing to perform the
         described action violates the rule in question.
      
      8. SHOULD, ENCOURAGED, RECOMMENDED: Before failing to perform the
         described action, the full implications of failing to perform
         it should (in the ordinary-language sense) be understood and
         carefully weighed.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2509/2 (Power=2)
Agoran Numbers

      A "number" is considered to refer to a real number, unless
      otherwise explicitly specified.  A "number of (items)", where
      (items) is a set of discrete entities, is considered to refer to a
      non-negative integer, unless otherwise explicitly specified.
      
      If a switch is defined as being associated with a specified set of
      numbers (a numerical switch), then the possible values for that
      switch are the numbers in that set. In particular, a natural or
      integer switch is a switch with possible values the non-negative
      integers or all integers, respectively. If a limit is further
      defined, the possible values are the numbers of the set within the
      specified limits.
      
      If 0 is in the specified values for a numerical switch and no
      default value is otherwise specified, 0 is the default value for
      that switch.
      
      If the rules describe mathematical operations to be used in
      flipping an instance of a numerical switch, the operations are
      interpreted as having common-sense mathematical application to
      determine that instance's resulting value. For example,
      "increasing a switch instance by M" is equivalent to "flipping a
      switch instance from its current value N to the value N+M". If the
      specified mathematical operation would result in a value outside
      that switch's defined set, the flipping CANNOT be performed, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2125/10 (Power=3)
Regulated Actions

      An action is regulated if: (1) the Rules limit, allow, enable, or
      permit its performance; (2) describe the circumstances under which
      the action would succeed or fail; or (3) the action would, as part
      of its effect, modify information for which some player is
      required to be a recordkeepor.
      
      A Regulated Action CAN only be performed as described by the
      Rules, and only using the methods explicitly specified in the
      Rules for performing the given action. The Rules SHALL NOT be
      interpreted so as to proscribe unregulated actions.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1023/39 (Power=2)
Agoran Time

      The following terms are defined:
      
      1. The phrase "in a timely fashion" means "within 7 days". This
         time period is set when the requirement is created (i.e. X days
         before the limit ends). A requirement to perform an action at
         an exact instant (e.g. "when X, Y SHALL Z"), but not "in the
         same message", is instead interpreted as a requirement to
         perform that action in a timely fashion after that instant.
      
      2. Agoran epochs:
      
           1. Agoran days begin at midnight UTC.
      
           2. Agoran weeks begin at midnight UTC on Monday. Eastman
              weeks begin at midnight UTC on the 1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd,
              and 29th of each Gregorian month; the fifth one of the
              month (if any) lasts till the end of the month.
      
           3. Agoran months begin at midnight UTC on the first day of
              each Gregorian month.
      
           4. Agoran quarters begin when the Agoran months of January,
              April, July, and October begin.
      
           5. Agoran years begin when the Agoran month of January
              begins.
      
           6. A pivot is either the instant at which Agora Nomic began
              (June 30, 1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200) or an instant at which
              at least one person won the game. When used as a period of
              time, a "Round" (historical syn: "game") is the period of
              time between a pivot and the next pivot.
      
         The "Agoran" qualifier is assumed unless a different definition
         is indicated (e.g. Eastman weeks). These definitions do not
         apply to relative durations (e.g. "within <number> days after
         <event>").
      
      3. Two points in time are within a month of each other if:
      
          1. they occur in the same Agoran month;
      
          2. they occur in two consecutive Agoran months, and the later
             of the two occurs in an earlier day in the month than the
             earlier one;
      
          3. they occur in two consecutive Agoran months on the same day
             of the month, and the later of the two occurs at the same
             or earlier time of day.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1728/41 (Power=3)
Dependent Action Methods

      The following methods of taking actions are known as "dependent
      actions":
      
      1. Without N Objections, where N is a positive integer no greater
         than 8 ("Without Objection" is shorthand for this method with
         N = 1);
      
      2. With N Support, where N is a positive integer ("With Support"
         is shorthand for this method with N = 1);
      
      3. With N Agoran Consent, where N is an integer multiple of 0.1
         with a minimum of 1 ("With Agoran Consent" is shorthand for
         this method with N = 1);
      
      4. With Notice; or
      
      5. With T Notice, where T is a time period.
      
      N is 1 unless otherwise specified.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2595/0 (Power=3)
Performing a Dependent Action

      A rule that purports to allow a person (the performer) to perform
      an action by a set of one or more dependent actions identified in
      Rule 1728 thereby allows em to perform the action by announcement
      if all of the following are true:
      
      1. A person (the initiator) published an announcement of intent
         that unambiguously, clearly, conspicuously, and without
         obfuscation specified the action intended to be taken and the
         method(s) to be used;
      
      2. The announcement referenced in paragraph (1) of this Rule
         unambiguously, clearly, conspicuously, and without obfuscation
         states:
      
         * the value of T, if the action is to be taken with T Notice;
           and
      
         * the value of N, if N is not equal to 1 and the action is to
           be taken Without N Objections, With N Support, or With N
           Agoran Consent;
      
      3. The announcement referenced in paragraph (1) of this Rule was
         published:
      
         * within the 14 days preceding the action, if the action is to
           be performed With N Support;
      
         * between 4 and 14 days preceding the action, if the action is
           to be performed Without N Objections, With N Agoran Consent,
           or With Notice; or
      
         * between T and 14 days preceding the action, if the action is
           to be performed With T Notice;
      
      4. At least one of the following is true:
      
           * the performer is the initiator;
      
           * the initiator was authorized to perform the action due to
             holding a rule-defined position now held by the performer;
             or
      
           * the initiator is authorized to perform the action, the
             action depends on support, the performer has supported the
             intent, and the rule authorizing the performance does not
             explicitly prohibit supporters from performing it;
      
      5. Agora is Satisfied with the announced intent, as defined by
         other Rules; and
      
      6. The conditions are all met, if any conditions were stated in
         the announcement of intent referenced in paragraph (1) of this
         Rule.
      
      The performer SHOULD publish a list of supporters and objectors if
      the action is to be taken with N Agoran Consent.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2124/24 (Power=2)
Agoran Satisfaction

      A Supporter of an intent to perform an action is an eligible
      entity who has publicly posted (and not withdrawn) support (syn.
      "consent") for an announcement of that intent. An Objector to an
      intent to perform an action is an eligible entity who has publicly
      posted (and not withdrawn) an objection to the announcement of
      that intent.
      
      The entities eligible to support or object to an intent to perform
      an action are, by default, all players, subject to modification by
      the document authorizing the dependent action. However, the
      previous sentence notwithstanding, the initiator of the intent is
      not eligible to support it.
      
      Agora is Satisfied with an intent to perform a specific action
      unless at least one of the following is true:
      
      1. The action is to be performed Without N Objections, and there
         are at least N Objectors to that intent.
      
      2. The action is to be performed With N support, and there are
         fewer than than N Supporters of that intent.
      
      3. The action is to be performed with N Agoran Consent, and the
         number of Supporters of the intent is less than or equal to N
         times the number of Objectors to the intent.
      
      The above notwithstanding, if an action depends on objections, and
      an objection to an intent to perform it has been withdrawn within
      the past 24 hours, then Agora is not Satisfied with that intent.
      
      The above notwithstanding, Agora is not satisfied with an intent
      if the Speaker has objected to it in the last 48 hours.
      
      A person CANNOT support or object to an announcement of intent
      before the intent is announced, or after e has withdrawn the same
      type of response.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2518/0 (Power=3)
Determinacy

      If a value CANNOT be reasonably determined (without circularity or
      paradox) from information reasonably available, or if it
      alternates indefinitely between values, then the value is
      considered to be indeterminate, otherwise it is determinate.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2505/0 (Power=1)
Random Choices

      When a Rule specifies that a random choice be made, then the
      choice shall be made using whatever probability distribution among
      the possible outcomes the Rule specifies, defaulting to a uniform
      probability distribution.
      
      The choice CAN be made using any physical or computational process
      whose probability distribution among the possible outcomes is
      reasonably close to that required by the Rules, and for which the
      final choice is not trivially predictable by the selecting person
      in advance. The selecting person SHOULD make the selection method
      public, and SHOULD use a method for which the final probability
      distribution can be readily confirmed.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Entities
   "Entity" is a confusing word to new players. This section describes
   what an entity is.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1586/9 (Power=2)
Definition and Continuity of Entities

      If multiple rules attempt to define an entity with the same name,
      then they refer to the same entity. A rule-defined entity's name
      CANNOT be changed to be the same as another rule-defined entity's
      name.
      
      A rule, contract, or regulation that refers to an entity by name
      refers to the entity that had that name when the rule first came
      to include that reference, even if the entity's name has since
      changed.
      
      If the entity that defines another entity is amended such that it
      no longer defines the second entity, then the second entity and
      its attributes cease to exist.
      
      If the entity that defines another entity is amended such that it
      defines the second entity both before and after the amendment, but
      with different attributes, then the second entity and its
      attributes continue to exist to whatever extent is possible under
      the new definitions.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2162/11 (Power=3)
Switches

      A type of switch is a property that the rules define as a switch,
      and specify the following:
      
      1. The type(s) of entity possessing an instance of that switch. No
         other entity possesses an instance of that switch.
      
      2. One or more possible values for instances of that switch,
         exactly one of which should be designated as the default. No
         values other than those listed are possible for instances of
         that switch, except that, if no default is specified, then
         rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the "null" value is a
         possible value for that switch, and is the default.
      
      3. Optionally, exactly one office whose holder tracks instances of
         that switch. That officer's (weekly, if not specified
         otherwise) report includes the value of each instance of that
         switch whose value is not its default value; a public document
         purporting to be this portion of that officer's report is
         self-ratifying, and implies that other instances are at their
         default value.
      
      At any given time, each instance of a switch has exactly one
      possible value for that type of switch. If an instance of a switch
      comes to have a value, it ceases to have any other value. If an
      instance of a switch would otherwise fail to have a possible
      value, it comes to have its default value.
      
      "To flip an instance of a switch" is to make it come to have a
      given value. "To become X" (where X is a possible value of
      exactly one of the subject's switches) is to flip that switch to
      X.
      
      If an action or set of actions would cause the value of an
      instance of a switch to become indeterminate, the instance instead
      takes on its last determinate and possible value, if any,
      otherwise it takes on its default value.
      
      A singleton switch is a switch for which Agora Nomic is the only
      entity possessing an instance of that switch.
      
      A boolean switch is a switch with values True and False. A
      positive boolean switch has a default of True; a negative boolean
      switch has a default of False.
      
      Attempting to flip an instance of a switch to a value it already
      has does not flip the switch. However, if a person is REQUIRED to
      flip a switch instance to a value it already has, then either
      attempting to do so using the required mechanism, or announcing
      that the switch already has the required value, fulfills the
      requirement without flipping the switch.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1688/9 (Power=3)
Power

      The Power of an entity is a non-negative rational number. An
      Instrument is an entity with positive Power.
      
      The Power of an entity cannot be set or modified except as
      stipulated by the Rules. All entities have Power zero except where
      specifically allowed by the rules.
      
      A Rule that makes a change, action, or value secured (hereafter
      the securing Rule) thereby makes it IMPOSSIBLE to perform that
      change or action, or to set or modify that value, except as
      allowed by an Instrument with Power greater than or equal to the
      change's Power Threshold.  This Threshold defaults to the securing
      Rule's Power, but CAN be lowered as allowed by that Rule
      (including by the Rule itself).
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2140/3 (Power=3)
Power Controls Mutability

      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no entity with power below
      the power of this rule can
      
      1. cause an entity to have power greater than its own.
      
      2. adjust the power of an instrument with power greater than its
         own.
      
      3. set or modify any other substantive aspect of an instrument
         with power greater than its own. A "substantive" aspect of an
         instrument is any aspect that affects the instrument's
         operation.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Proposals
   Proposals are a staple of Nomic games. If you're a new player, this
   is another important section, since the way proposals work in this
   Nomic is a little bit complicated.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2350/11 (Power=3)
Proposals

      A proposal is a type of entity consisting of a body of text and
      other attributes. A player CAN create a proposal by announcement,
      specifying its text and optionally specifying any of the following
      attributes:
      
      * An associated title.
      
      * A list of co-authors (which must be persons other than the
        author).
      
      * An adoption index.
      
      Creating a proposal adds it to the Proposal Pool. Once a proposal
      is created, neither its text nor any of the aforementioned
      attributes can be changed. The author (syn. proposer) of a
      proposal is the person who submitted it.
      
      If a decision of whether to adopt a proposal was resolved as
      FAILED QUORUM in the last seven days, the Promotor CAN once add
      the proposal back to the Proposal Pool by announcement.
      
      The author of a proposal in the Proposal Pool CAN remove (syn.
      retract, withdraw) it from the Pool by announcement.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1607/44 (Power=3)
Distribution

      The Promotor is an office; its holder is responsible for receiving
      and distributing proposals.
      
      Determining whether to adopt a proposal is an Agoran decision. For
      this decision, the vote collector is the Assessor, the adoption
      index is initially the adoption index of the proposal, or 1.0 if
      the proposal does not have one, and the text, author, and
      coauthors of the proposal are essential parameters. Initiating
      such a decision is known as distribution, and removes the proposal
      from the Proposal Pool.
      
      The Promotor CAN distribute a proposal which is in the Proposal
      Pool at any time, by announcement.
      
      In a given Agoran week, the Promotor SHALL, as part of eir weekly
      duties, distribute all proposals in the Proposal Pool except for
      those exempted from automatic distribution by other rules.
      
      Distributed proposals have ID numbers, to be assigned by the
      Promotor.
      
      If there is a Proposal in the Pool that it would otherwise be
      IMPOSSIBLE for any player to distribute, then any player CAN
      distribute that Proposal Without 3 Objections.
      
      The Promotor's report includes a list of all proposals in the
      Proposal Pool, along with their text and attributes. This portion
      of a public document purporting to be a Promotor's report is
      self-ratifying.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2137/2 (Power=1)
The Assessor

      The Assessor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      collecting votes and keeping track of related properties.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 106/40 (Power=3)
Adopting Proposals

      When a decision about whether to adopt a proposal is resolved, if
      the outcome is ADOPTED, then the proposal in question is adopted,
      and unless other rules prevent it from taking effect, its power is
      set to the minimum of four and its adoption index, and then it
      takes effect. Except as prohibited by other rules, a proposal that
      takes effect CAN and does, as part of its effect, apply the
      changes that it specifies. Clearly marked comments are considered
      to be removed from the proposal before it takes effect, unless
      otherwise stated by the proposal. If the proposal cannot make some
      such changes, this does not preclude the other changes from taking
      place.
      
      If there is no Agoran Decision to adopt a particular proposal that
      has an outcome of ADOPTED, that proposal CANNOT take effect, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.
      
      Preventing a proposal from taking effect is a secured change; this
      does not apply to generally preventing changes to specified areas
      of the gamestate, nor to a proposal preventing itself from taking
      effect (its no- effect clause is generally interpreted as applying
      only to the rest of the proposal). Except insofar as the actions
      performed by a proposal happen one after another, rather than
      simultaneously, a proposal's effect is instantaneous. A proposal
      can neither delay nor extend its own effect. Once a propsal
      finishes taking effect, its power is set to 0.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2597/0 (Power=1)
Line-item Veto

      The Comptrollor is an imposed office.  When the office is vacant,
      the ADoP CAN, by announcement, set the Comptrollor to a player
      chosen at random from the set of current Officers, excepting any
      player who was most recently the Comptrollor.  The ADoP SHALL do
      so in a timely fashion after the office becomes vacant.
      
      When the Comptrollor office has been held for the same player for
      30 days, it becomes vacant.
      
      A Notice of Veto is a body of text, published by the Comptrollor,
      clearly, directly, and without obfuscation labelled within the
      publishing message as being a Notice of Veto.
      
      When a Comptrollor publishes a Notice of Veto, the office of
      Comptrollor becomes vacant.
      
      If the text of a Notice of Veto clearly indicates certain
      provisions within specified Proposals as being vetoed, and the
      voting period for a decision to adopt the proposal is ongoing
      when the Notice is published, then the provisions are vetoed. For
      the purposes of this Rule, each individual change specified within
      a proposal's text is a "provision".
      
      Vetoed provisions in a proposal are prohibited from being applied
      when the proposal takes effect (that is, that part of the
      proposal's effect CANNOT be applied).
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Rules & Regulations
   Ah, yes. What would any game be without rules? And these rules
   describe how rules work. This section also describes the governance
   of the Rulekeepor.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2141/10 (Power=3)
Role and Attributes of Rules

      A rule is a type of instrument with the capacity to govern the
      game generally, and is always taking effect. A rule's content
      takes the form of a text, and is unlimited in scope.
      
      Every rule has power between 0.1 and 4.0 inclusive. It is not
      possible for a rule to have a power outside this range.
      
      Rules have ID numbers, to be assigned by the Rulekeepor.
      
      Every rule shall have a title to aid in identification. If a rule
      ever does not have a title, the the Rulekeepor CAN and SHALL
      assign a title to it by announcement in a timely fashion.
      
      For the purposes of rules governing modification of instruments,
      the text, power, ID number, and title of a rule are all
      substantive aspects of the rule. However, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the Rulekeepor CAN set rule aspects as described
      elsewhere in this rule.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 217/12 (Power=3)
Interpreting the Rules

      When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
      takes precedence. Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
      unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense, past
      judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the game.
      
      Definitions and prescriptions in the rules are only to be applied
      using direct, forward reasoning; in particular, an absurdity that
      can be concluded from the assumption that a statement about
      rule-defined concepts is false does not constitute proof that it
      is true. Definitions in lower-powered Rules do not overrule
      common-sense interpretations or common definitions of terms in
      higher-powered rules, but may constructively make reasonable
      clarifications to those definitions. For this purpose, a
      clarification is reasonable if and only if it adds detail without
      changing the underlying general meaning of the term and without
      causing the higher powered rule to be read in a way inconsistent
      with its text.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any rule change that would
      (1) prevent a person from initiating a formal process to resolve
      matters of controversy, in the reasonable expectation that the
      controversy will thereby be resolved; or (2) prevent a person from
      causing formal reconsideration of any judicial determination that
      e should be punished, is wholly void and without effect.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1030/12 (Power=3.2)
Precedence between Rules

      In a conflict between Rules, the conflict shall be resolved by
      performing the following comparisons in the sequence written in
      this rule, until the conflict is resolved.
      
      - In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
        the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
        Power; otherwise,
      
      - If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
        precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
        determining precedence relations, then the determinations of the
        precedence-determining Rule shall be used to resolve the
        conflicts; otherwise,
      
      - If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
        itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or takes
        precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
        provisions shall be used to resolve the conflict, unless they
        lead to contradictions between each other; otherwise,
      
      - If any of the rules in conflict have ID numbers, then the Rule
        with the lowest ID number takes precedence; otherwise,
      
      - The Rule enacted earliest takes precedence.
      
      Clauses in any other rule that broadly claim precedence (e.g. over
      "all rules" of a certain class) shall be, prima facie, considered
      to be limited claims of precedence or deference that are
      applicable only when such claims are evaluated as described within
      the above sequence.
      
      No change to the Ruleset can occur that would cause a Rule to
      directly claim precedence over this Rule as a means of determining
      precedence. This applies to changes by the enactment or amendment
      of a Rule, or of any other form. This Rule takes precedence over
      any Rule that would permit such a change to the Ruleset.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2240/1 (Power=3)
No Cretans Need Apply

      In a conflict between clauses of the same Rule, if exactly one
      claims precedence over the other, then it takes precedence;
      otherwise, the later clause takes precedence.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 105/19 (Power=3)
Rule Changes

      Where permitted by other rules, an instrument generally can, as
      part of its effect,
      
      1. enact a rule. The new rule has power equal to the minimum of
         the power specified by the enacting instrument, defaulting to
         one if the enacting instrument does not specify or if it
         specifies a power less than 0.1, and the maximum power
         permitted by other rules. The enacting instrument may specify a
         title for the new rule, which if present shall prevail. The ID
         number of the new rule cannot be specified by the enacting
         instrument; any attempt to so specify is null and void.
      
      2. repeal a rule. When a rule is repealed, it ceases to be a rule,
         its power is set to 0, and the Rulekeepor need no longer
         maintain a record of it.
      
      3. reenact a rule. A repealed rule identified by its most recent
         rule number MUST be reenacted with the same ID number and the
         next change identifier. If no text is specified, the rule is
         reenacted with the same text it had when it was most recently
         repealed. If the reenacting proposal provides new text for the
         rule, the rule SHOULD have materially the same purpose as did
         the repealed version. Unless specified otherwise by the
         re-enacting instrument, a re-enacted rule has power equal to
         the power it had at the time of its repeal (or power 1, if
         power was not defined at the time of that rule's repeal). If
         the re-enacting instrument is incapable of setting the
         re-enacted rule's power to that value, then the re-enactment is
         null and void.
      
      4. amend the text of a rule.
      
      5. retitle a rule.
      
      6. change the power of a rule.
      
      A rule change is any effect that falls into the above classes.
      Rule changes always occur sequentially, never simultaneously.
      
      Any ambiguity in the specification of a rule change causes that
      change to be void and without effect. An inconsequential variation
      in the quotation of an existing rule does not constitute ambiguity
      for the purposes of this rule, but any other variation does.
      
      A rule change is wholly prevented from taking effect unless its
      full text was published, along with an unambiguous and clear
      specification of the method to be used for changing the rule, at
      least 4 days and no more than 60 days before it would otherwise
      take effect.
      
      This rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be
      created, modified, or destroyed, or by which an entity can become
      a rule or cease to be a rule.

Rule 2493/5 (Power=3)
Regulations

      A regulation is an textual entity defined as such by this rule,
      and under the authority of an person, known as its Promulgator. A
      regulation must be authorized by a rule (its parent rule) in order
      to exist. It has only the effect that rule explicitly gives it.
      
      A regulation CAN be enacted, amended, and repealed as specified by
      its parent rule. By default, a Promulgator can enact, amend, or
      repeal a regulation with 2 Agoran Consent. Regulations are tracked
      in their Promulgator's weekly report.

      The Rulekeepor's Weekly report includes the Short Logical Ruleset.
      The Rulekeepor's Monthly report includes the Full Logical Ruleset.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1681/21 (Power=1)
The Logical Rulesets

      The Short Logical Ruleset (SLR) is a format of the ruleset. In
      this format, each rule is assigned to a category, and the rules
      are grouped according to their category.
      
      Rules are assigned to, ordered within, or moved between
      categories, and categories are added, changed, or empty categories
      removed, as the Rulekeepor sees fit.
      
      The listing of each rule in the SLR must include the rule's ID
      number, revision number, power, title, and text.
      
      The Rulekeepor is strongly DISCOURAGED from including any
      additional information in the SLR, except that which increases the
      readability of the SLR.
      
      The Full Logical Ruleset (FLR) is a format of the ruleset. In this
      format, rules are assigned to the same category and presented in
      the same order as in the SLR. The FLR must contain all the
      information required to be in the SLR, and any historical
      annotations which the Rulekeepor is required to record.
      
      The Rulekeepor SHOULD also include any other information which e
      feels may be helpful in the use of the ruleset in the FLR.
      
      Whenever a rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeepor SHALL record
      a historical annotation to the rule indicating:
      
      1. The type of change.
      
      2. The date on which the change took effect.
      
      3. The mechanism that specified the change.
      
      4. If the rule was changed due to a proposal, then that proposal's
         ID number, author, and co-author(s) (if any).

Rule 693/16 (Power=3)
Agoran Decisions

      When the rules calls for an Agoran decision to be made, the
      decision-making process takes place in the following three
      stages, each described elsewhere:
      
      1. Initiation of the decision.
      
      2. Voting of the people.
      
      3. Resolution of the decision.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 107/20 (Power=3)
Initiating Agoran Decisions

      An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
      initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
      to initiate the decision. This notice is invalid if it lacks any
      of the following information, and the lack is correctly identified
      within one week after the notice is published:
      
      1. The matter to be decided (for example, "the adoption of
         proposal 4781");
      
      2. The voting method;
      
      3. A clear description of the valid options;
      
      4. The identity of the vote collector; and
      
      5. Any additional information defined by the rules as essential
         parameters.
      
      The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting period
      for the decision. The voting period lasts for 7 days. The minimum
      voting period for a decision with at least two options is five
      days. The vote collector for a decision with less than two options
      CAN and SHALL end the voting period by announcement, if it has not
      ended already, and provided that e resolves the decision in the
      same message.
      
      The voting period for a decision cannot be set or changed to a
      duration longer than fourteen days.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2528/0 (Power=3)
Voting Methods

      Each Agoran decision has a voting method, which must be
      AI-majority, instant runoff, or first-past-the-post. The voting
      method is that specified by the authorizing authority, or
      first-past-the-post by default.
      
      Each Agoran decision has a set of valid options (the choices that
      the voters are being asked to select from) and valid votes (the
      ways in which the voters can express their opinion or lack
      thereof. For AI-majority decisions, the valid options are FOR and
      AGAINST; for other decisions, the valid options are defined by
      other rules.
      
      The valid votes on an Agoran decision are:
      
      1. PRESENT;
      
      2. The valid conditional votes, as defined by rules of power at
         least that of this rule; and
      
      3. For an instant runoff decision, the ordered lists of entities.
      
      4. For any other decision, the valid options.

Voting on Agoran Decisions

      An entity submits a ballot on an Agoran decision by publishing a

      1. The ballot is submitted during the voting period for the
         decision.
      
      2. The entity casting the ballot (the voter) was, at the
         initiation of the decision, a player.
      
      3. The ballot clearly identifies the matter to be decided.
      
      4. The ballot clearly identifies a valid vote, as determined by
         the voting method.
      
      5. The ballot clearly sets forth the voter's intent to place
         the identified vote.
      
      6. The voter has no other valid ballots on the same decision.
      
      A valid ballot is a ballot, correctly submitted, that has not
      been withdrawn. During the voting period of an Agoran decision,
      an entity CAN by announcement withdraw (syn. retract) a ballot
      that e submitted on that decision. To "change" one's vote is to
      retract eir previous ballot (if any), then submit a new one.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 208/13 (Power=3)
Resolving Agoran Decisions

      The vote collector for an unresolved Agoran decision CAN resolve
      it by announcement, indicating the outcome. If it was required to
      be initiated, then e SHALL resolve it in a timely fashion after
      the end of the voting period. To be valid, this announcement must
      satisfy the following conditions:
      
      1. It is published after the voting period has ended.
      
      2. It clearly identifies the matter to be resolved.
      
      3. It specifies the number of voters (or a list of the voters).
         For these purposes and for determining quorum, a "voter" is
         someone who submitted a ballot on the decision that was valid
         when it was submitted and also valid (i.e. not withdrawn or
         otherwise invalidated) at the end of the voting period.
      
      4. It specifies the outcome, as described elsewhere, and, if there
         was more than one valid option, provides a tally of the voters'
         valid ballots.
      
      Each Agoran decision has exactly one vote collector, defaulting to
      the initiator of the decision. If the vote collector is defined by
      reference to a position (or, in the default case, if the initiator
      was so defined), then the vote collector is the current holder of
      that position.
      
      This rule takes precedence over any rule that would provide
      another mechanism by which an Agoran decision may be resolved.
      
      In general, changes to the gamestate due to the outcome of an
      Agoran decision take effect when the decision is resolved.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 955/26 (Power=3)
Determining the Will of Agora

      Each Agoran decision has a voting method, which determines how
      voters may vote on it and how to calculate the outcome. The
      strength of a ballot is the voting strength of the voter who cast
      it on that Agoran decision.
      
      1. For an AI-majority decision, let F be the total strength of all
         valid ballots cast FOR a decision, A be the same for AGAINST,
         and AI be the adoption index of the decision. The outcome is
         ADOPTED if F/A >= AI and F/A > 1 (or F>0 and A=0), otherwise
         REJECTED.
      
      2. For an instant runoff decision, the outcome is whichever option
         wins according to the standard definition of instant runoff.
         For this purpose, a ballot of strength N is treated as if it
         were N distinct ballots expressing the same preferences. In
         case multiple valid options tie for the lowest number of votes
         at any stage, the vote collector CAN and must, in the
         announcement of the decision's resolution, select one such
         option to eliminate; if, for M > 1, all eir possible choices in
         the next M stages would result in the same set of options being
         eliminated, e need not specify the order of elimination. If an
         entity that is part of a valid vote is not a valid option at
         the end of the voting period, or disqualified by the rule
         providing for the decision, then that entity is eliminated
         prior to the first round of counting.
      
      3. For a first-past-the-post decision, the outcome is whichever
         option received the highest total strength of valid ballots. In
         case of a tie, the vote collector CAN and must, in the
         announcement of the decision's resolution, select one of the
         leaders as the outcome.
      
      The previous notwithstanding:
      
      - If there is more than one option, and the number of voters is
        less than the quorum of that decision, the outcome is instead
        FAILED QUORUM.
      
      - If there are no valid options, the outcome is null.
      
      The outcome of a decision is determined when it is resolved, and
      cannot change thereafter.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 879/35 (Power=2)
Quorum

      Each Agoran Decision has a quorum. This is a number set when the
      decision is created, and thereafter cannot be changed. When a
      person initiates an Agoran Decision, that person SHALL state the
      quorum of that decision. However, incorrectly stating the quorum
      of a decision does not invalidate the initiation, nor does it
      actually change the quorum of the decision.
      
      The quorum that an Agoran Decision gains as it is created can be
      defined by other rules of power 2 or greater. If no other rule
      defines the quorum of an Agoran Decision, the quorum for that
      decision is equal to 2/3 of the number of voters on the Agoran
      Decision to adopt a proposal that had been most recently resolved
      at the time of that decision's initiation, the whole rounded to
      the nearest integer (breaking ties upward).
      
      As an exception to the previous paragraph, the quorum of an
      Agoran Decision can never be less than 2. If the rules would
      attempt to set the quorum of an Agoran Decision to less than 2,
      it is set to 2 instead.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2422/4 (Power=3)
Voting Strength

      The voting strength of an entity on an Agoran decision is an
      integer between 0 and 5 inclusive, defined by rules of power 2
      or greater. If not otherwise specified, the voting strength of
      an entity on an Agoran decision is 3.
      
      When multiple rules set or modify an entity's voting strength on
      an Agoran decision, it shall be determined by first applying the
      rule(s) which set it to a specific value, using the ordinary
      precedence of rules, and then applying the rules, other than
      this one, which modify it, in numerical order by ID. Finally, if
      the result of the calculation is not an integer, it is rounded
      up, and then if it is outside the allowable range of values for
      voting strength, it is set to the the minimum value if it was
      less and the maximum value if it was more.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2127/11 (Power=3)
Conditional Votes

      A conditional vote on an Agoran decision is a vote which indicates
      a vote based on some condition(s). A conditional vote is evaluated
      at the end of the voting period and, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, is clearly specified if and only if the value of
      the condition(s) is/are determinate at the end of the voting
      period. If the conditional is clearly specified, and evaluates to
      a valid vote, it is counted as that vote; otherwise, it is counted
      as PRESENT.
      
      Any vote which is clearly expressed as a conditional, e.g. "FOR if
      <X> is true, AGAINST otherwise", is a valid conditional vote that
      evaluates as specified.
      
      A vote endorsing another person is equivalent to a conditional
      vote evaluating to the vote specified in that person's valid
      ballot on the decision, if any.
      
      For an instant runoff decision, a vote consisting of a list, one
      or more entries of which are valid conditional votes, and the
      remaining entries of which are valid options, is a valid
      conditional vote. Such a vote is evaluated by evaluating each
      conditional entry to a list of votes (or an empty list, if it
      evaluates to PRESENT either directly or indirectly), and then
      concatenating those lists with the specified valid options in the
      order they occurred in the original vote.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2168/7 (Power=1)
Extending the voting period

      Whenever the voting period of an Agoran decision would end, and
      the result would be FAILED QUORUM, the length of the voting period
      for that decision is instead increased to 14 days, except if it is
      already that length, provided this has not already happened for
      the decision in question.
      
      Upon such an occurrence, the vote collector for the decision SHALL
      issue a humiliating public reminder naming the slackers who have
      not yet cast any votes on it despite being eligible, and CAN end
      its voting period by announcement (resolving it constitutes an
      implicit announcement that its voting period is first ended) if
      the result would no longer be FAILED QUORUM, or if the decision is
      whether to adopt a proposal and no voter (other than possibly the
      proposal's author) has voted FOR.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1950/34 (Power=3)
Decisions with Adoption Indices

      Adoption index (AI) is an untracked switch possessed by Agoran
      decisions and proposals.  For decisions, the possible values are
      "none" (default) or integral multiples of 0.1 from 1.0 to 9.9.
      For proposals, the possible values are integral multiples of 0.1
      from 1.0 to 9.9 (default 1.0).
      
      Adoption index is secured with a power threshold of 2.
      
      Adoption index is an essential parameter of an Agoran decision if
      that decision has an adoption index.
      
      For any Agoran decision with an adoption index, the voting method
      is AI-majority.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2034/10 (Power=3)
Vote Protection and Cutoff for Challenges

      A public message purporting to resolve an Agoran decision
      constitutes self-ratifying claims that
      
      1. such a decision existed,
      
      2. it had the number of voters indicated,
      
      3. it was resolved as indicated, and
      
      4. (if the indicated outcome was to adopt a proposal) such a
         proposal existed, was adopted, and took effect.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Offices & Reporting
   Players who hold offices have control over and track various
   different mechanics. These rules govern the special
   responsibilities that officers have.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1006/43 (Power=2)
Offices

      An Office is a position described as an Office by the Rules.
      Officeholder is an office switch tracked by the ADoP, with
      possible values of any person or "vacant" (default). An officer is
      the holder of an office, who may be referred to by the name of
      that office. If the holder of an office is ever not a player, it
      becomes vacant.
      
      An imposed office is an office described as such by the rule
      defining it. All others are elected. A person CANNOT be made the
      holder of an elected office without eir explicit or reasonably
      implied consent.
      
      A holder of an elected office who did not become its holder by
      winning an election, and has not won an election for that office
      since, is an interim holder. An elected office that is either
      vacant or has an interim holder is an interim office.
      
      The holder of an elected office CAN resign it by announcement,
      causing it to become vacant. The non-interim holder of an elected
      office CAN, With 3 Support, resign the office while appointing
      another player to become the holder of the office, provided that
      other player is one of the Supporters. Any player CAN cause an
      office to become vacant without 2 objections.
      
      When a proposal takes effect and creates a new office, if the
      proposal does not specify otherwise, the author of that proposal
      becomes the holder of the office.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2154/52 (Power=2)
Election Procedure

      A player CAN initiate an election for a specified office:
      
      a) With 2 Support, if either the office is interim or the most
         recent election for that office was resolved more than 90 days
         prior, and provided that the initiator becomes a candidate in
         the same message.
      
      b) By announcement, if e is the ADoP and if the office is interim,
         or if e is the holder of that office.
      
      The above notwithstanding, an election for an office CANNOT be
      initiated if one is already in progress.
      
      When an election is initiated, it enters the nomination period,
      which lasts for 4 days. After an election is initiated and until
      nominations close, any player CAN become a candidate by
      announcement. A candidate ceases to be a candidate if e ceases to
      be a player during the election or if holding the office would
      make em Overpowered.
      
      An election is contested if it has two or more candidates at the
      end of the nomination period, and uncontested otherwise. For a
      contested election, nominations close at the end of the poll's
      voting period. For an uncontested election, nominations close at
      the end of the nomination period.
      
      In a timely fashion after the nomination period ends, the ADoP CAN
      and SHALL:
      
      1) If the election is contested, initiate an Agoran decision to
         select the winner of the election (the poll). For this
         decision, the Vote Collector is the ADoP, the valid options are
         the candidates for that election (including those who become
         candidates after its initiation), and the voting method is
         instant runoff. When the poll is resolved, its outcome, if a
         player, wins the election. If the outcome is not a player, the
         election ends with no winner.
      
      2) If POSSIBLE per the following paragraph, end the election
         immediately.
      
      If at any point an uncontested election has a single candidate,
      then any player CAN declare them the winner of the election by
      announcement. If at any point an uncontested election has no
      candidates, then any player CAN declare the election ended with no
      winner by announcement.
      
      When a player wins an election, e is installed into the associated
      office and the election ends.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2573/0 (Power=2)
Impeachment

      A player CAN be expelled (impeached) from a specified elected
      office which e holds with 2 Agoran Consent. When a person is
      impeached from an office, an election is immediately opened for
      that office. Players SHOULD NOT use this method of removal unless
      the officer has abused the powers of eir office or otherwise shown
      emself unworthy the trust of Agora.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2160/19 (Power=3)
Deputisation

      A player (the deputy) CAN perform an action ordinarily reserved
      for an office-holder as if e held the office if
      
      1. the rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of
         holding that office, to perform the action (this requirement is
         fulfilled by the deputy performing the action);
      
      2. it would be POSSIBLE for the deputy to perform the action,
         other than by deputisation, if e held the office;
      
      3. either (i) a time limit by which the rules require the action
         to be performed has expired or (ii) the office is vacant;
      
      4. either (i) the office is vacant, (ii) the aforementioned time
         limit expired more than fourteen days ago, or (iii) the deputy
         announced between two and fourteen days earlier that e intended
         to deputise for that office for the purposes of the particular
         action; and
      
      5. the deputy, when performing the action, announces that e is
         doing so by deputisation or by temporary deputisation
      
      When a player deputises for an elected office, e becomes the
      holder of that office, unless the action being performed would
      already install someone into that office, and/or unless the
      deputisiation is temporary.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2138/24 (Power=1)
The Associate Director of Personnel

      The Associate Director of Personnel (ADoP) is an office; its
      holder is responsible for keeping track of officers.
      
      The ADoP's report includes the following:
      
      1. The date of the last change (if any) to each office's
         Officeholder.
      2. The current status of the ongoing election for that office or,
         if there is no ongoing election for that office, the date on
         which the last election ended
      3. For filled elected offices, whether or not the holder is
         interim.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2472/3 (Power=2)
Office Incompatibilities

      Some pairs of office are incompatible:
      
      1. Prime Minister and Speaker
      
      2. Promotor and Assessor
      
      3. Assessor and ADoP
      
      4. Referee and Arbitor
      
      A player is Overpowered if e holds two offices which are
      incompatible with each other. Rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, a player CANNOT be installed into an office if
      doing so would make em Overpowered.
      
      If a player is Overpowered, any player CAN, with Notice, Demand
      Resignation from em. When this occurs, each office that the
      Overpowered player holds becomes vacant.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2143/27 (Power=1)
Official Reports and Duties

      For each person:
      
      1. If any task is defined by the rules as part of that person's
         weekly duties, then e SHALL perform it at least once each week.
         If any information is defined by the rules as part of that
         person's weekly report, then e SHALL maintain all such
         information, and the publication of all such information is
         part of eir weekly duties.
      
      2. If any task is defined by the rules as part of that person's
         monthly duties, then e SHALL perform it at least once each
         month. If any information is defined by the rules as part of
         that person's monthly report, then e SHALL maintain all such
         information, and the publication of all such information is
         part of eir monthly duties.
      
      Any information defined by the rules as part of a person's report,
      without specifying which one, is part of eir weekly report.
      Failure of a person to perform any duty required of em within the
      allotted time is the Class-2 crime of Tardiness.
      
      An official duty for an office is any duty that the Rules
      specifically assign to that office's holder in particular
      (regardless of eir identity).
      
      A person SHALL NOT publish information that is inaccurate or
      misleading while performing an official duty, or within a document
      purporting to be part of any person or office's weekly or monthly
      report.
      
      Reports SHALL be published in plain text. Tabular data must line
      up properly when viewed in a monospaced font. Publishing a report
      that deviates from these restrictions is the Class 2 Crime of
      Making My Eyes Bleed.
      
      Officers SHOULD maintain a publicly visible copy of their reports
      on the World Wide Web, and they SHOULD publish the address of this
      copy along with their published reports.
      
      A convergence is any change to the gamestate that has, in
      accordance with the rules, been designated as such. A change to
      the gamestate SHOULD NOT be designated as a convergence unless it
      is designed to resolve gamestate ambiguity. Designating a change
      as a convergence is secured; any player CAN do so with 3 Agoran
      Consent. When officeholders provide historical information, they
      NEED NOT accurately document the changes made by the convergence
      or related ambiguities, provided that they instead note that the
      convergence occurred. Information about a convergence (but not the
      resulting state) is inherently uncertain and is thus excluded from
      self-ratification.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2379/0 (Power=1)
No News Is Some News

      If the rules define a report as including a list, then while that
      list is empty, that report includes the fact that it is empty.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Documents
   Documents are little bits of text that can be ratified, therefore
   modifying the gamestate slightly.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1551/19 (Power=3.1)
Ratification

      A public document is part (possibly all) of a public message.
      
      When a public document is ratified, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the gamestate is modified to what it would be if,
      at the time the ratified document was published, the gamestate had
      been minimally modified to make the ratified document as true and
      accurate as possible; however, if the document explicitly
      specifies a different past time as being the time the document was
      true, the specified time is used to determine the minimal
      modifications. Such a modification cannot add inconsistencies
      between the gamestate and the rules, and it cannot include rule
      changes unless the ratified document explicitly and unambiguously
      recites either the changes or the resulting properties of the
      rule(s). If no such modification is possible, or multiple
      substantially distinct possible modifications would be equally
      appropriate, the ratification fails.
      
      An internally inconsistent document generally cannot be ratified;
      however, if such a document can be divided into a summary section
      and a main section, where the only purpose of the summary section
      is to summarize information in the main section, and the main
      section is internally consistent, ratification of the document
      proceeds as if it contained only the main section.
      
      Text purportedly about previous instances of ratification (e.g. a
      report's date of last ratification) is excluded from ratification.
      The rules may define additional information that is considered to
      be part of the document for the purposes of ratification; such
      definitions are secured at a Power Threshold of 3.
      
      Ratifying a public document is secured with power threshold 3.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2202/6 (Power=3)
Ratification Without Objection

      Any player CAN, without objection, ratify a public document,
      specifying its scope.
      
      Ratification Without Objection CANNOT cause the repeal, amendment,
      enactment, or mutation of any Rule, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding.
      
      A player SHALL NOT knowingly use or announce intent to use
      Ratification Without Objection to ratify a (prior to ratification)
      document containing incorrect or Indeterminate information when a
      corrected document could be produced with reasonable effort,
      unless the general nature of the document's error and reason for
      ratifying it is clearly and plainly described in the announcement
      of intent. Such ratification or announcement of intent to ratify
      is the Class-8 Crime of Endorsing Forgery.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2201/8 (Power=3)
Self-Ratification

      A public document defined by the rules as self-ratifying is
      ratified when it is continuously undoubted for one week.
      
      A doubt is an explicit public challenge via one of the following
      methods, identifying a document and explaining the scope and
      nature of a perceived error in it:
      
      1. An inquiry case, appropriate for questions of legal
         interpretation.
      
      2. A claim of error, appropriate for matters of fact. The
         publisher of the original document SHALL (if e was required to
         publish that document) or SHOULD (otherwise) do one of the
         following in a timely fashion, in an announcement that clearly
         cites the claim of error:
      
         1. Deny the claim (causing it to cease to be a doubt).
      
         2. Publish a revision.
      
         3. Initiate an inquiry case regarding the truth of the claim
            (if the subject is actually a matter of law), or cite a
            relevant existing inquiry case.

========================================================================
Justice
   So you've broken a rule. Now what? This section describes Blots, the
   main method of punishment for Agorans.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2556/0 (Power=3)
Penalties

      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, an impure person CANNOT win
      the game.
      
      The voting strength of a player on an Agoran Decision is reduced
      by 1 for every 3 blots in eir possession.
      
      A player CAN, with 7 days notice, deregister (exile) a specified
      player (the outlaw) who has more than 40 blots.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2555/2 (Power=2)
Blots

      Blots are an indestructible fixed currency with ownership
      restricted to persons. A person with 1 or more blots is Impure, a
      person with 0 blots is Pure. An impure unregistered person is a
      Fugitive.
      
      To Levy a Fine of N on a person, where N is a positive integer, is
      to grant em N blots. To expunge a blot is to destroy it.
      
      Levying fines and destroying blots are each secured with a power
      threshold of 1.7.
      
      The Referee is an office, and the recordkeepor for blots.
      
      If a player has neither gained blots nor expunged any blots from
      emself in the current Agoran week, e CAN expunge 1 blot from
      emself by announcement.
      
      At the beginning of each quarter, half (rounded down) of each
      fugitive's blots are destroyed.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2478/9 (Power=1.7)
Vigilante Justice

      A player CAN by announcement, but subject to the provisions of
      this rule, Point eir Finger at a person (the perp) who plays the
      game, citing an alleged violation of the rules by that person.
      
      When a player Points a Finger, the investigator SHALL investigate
      the allegation and CAN, and in a timely fashion SHALL, conclude
      the investigation by:
      
      - Imposing the Cold Hand of Justice on the perp, as described
        elsewhere; or
      
      - if e believes that no rules violation occurred or that it would
        be ILLEGAL or INEFFECTIVE to levy a fine for it, announcing the
        Finger Pointing to be Shenanigans.
      
      The Referee is by default the investigator for all Finger
      Pointing. When a Finger, other than the Arbitor's, is Pointed over
      an allegation related to the official duties or powers of the
      Referee, then the Arbitor CAN, by announcement, take over the
      investigation and thereby become the investigator.
      
      The Referee CANNOT Point eir Finger. The Arbitor CANNOT Point eir
      Finger at the Referee.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2479/6 (Power=1.7)
Official Justice

      Subject to the provisions of this rule, the Referee CAN, by
      announcement, impose Summary Judgment on a player. When e does so,
      e levies a fine of up to 2 Blots on em. If e does not specify the
      number of Blots in the fine, the attempt to impose Summary
      Judgment is INEFFECTIVE. Summary Judgement is imposed on the
      Referee's own initiative, and not in response to any official
      proceeding.
      
      The Referee CANNOT impose Summary Judgement more than three times
      a week.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2557/2 (Power=1.7)
Sentencing Guidelines

      When the rules authorize an investigator to impose the Cold Hand
      of Justice for a violation, e CAN do so by levying a fine of B on
      the perp by announcement, within the following guidelines:
      
      - B is at least 1 and at most twice the base value of the
        violation.
      
      - If the violation is described by the rules as a Class N crime,
        then N is the base value; otherwise the base value is 2.
      
      - The fine SHOULD be reduced to the degree that the violation is a
        minor, accidental, and/or inconsequential infraction.
      
      - The fine SHOULD be increased to the degree that the violation is
        willful, profitable, egregious, or an abuse of an official
        position.
      
      Optionally, in the same message in which e imposes justice, the
      investigator CAN specify that the violation is forgivable,
      specifying up to 10 words to be included in an apology.  If the
      investigator does so, the perp CAN, in a timely fashion, expunge P
      blots from emself, where P is the minimum of the value of the fine
      and 3, by publishing a formal apology of at least 200 words and
      including all the specified words, explaining eir error, shame,
      remorse, and ardent desire for self-improvement.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2531/5 (Power=2)
Referee Accountability

      Any attempt to levy a fine is INEFFECTIVE if:
      
        (1) it does not include value of the fine in blots, the name of
            the person being fined (the perp), and the specific reason
            for the fine;
      
      Any attempt to levy a fine pursuant to the imposition of the Cold
      Hand of Justice is INEFFECTIVE if:
      
        (1) it attempts to levy a fine on a person for an action or
            inaction which e (more likely than not) did not commit;
      
        (2) it attempts to levy a fine for an action or inaction which
            is not prohibited by the rules;
      
        (3) it attempts to levy a fine with a value that is blatantly
            and obviously unsuited to the conduct which constitutes the
            reason for its levy or to the person on whom it is being
            levied;
      
        (4) it attempts to levy a fine (i) by summary judgement more
            than 14 days after the action constituting the reason for
            the fine or (ii) based upon the investigation of of a Finger
            that had been Pointed more than 14 days after the action
            constituting the reason for the fine;
      
        (5) it attempts to levy a fine on a player for failing to take
            an action within the time period set by the Rules and that
            time period had expired (i) more than 14 days prior to the
            attempted fine, if the attempted fine is imposed by summary
            judgement or (ii) more than 14 days prior to the Pointed
            Finger, if the fine is imposed based on an investigation of
            such Finger;
      
        (6) it attempts to levy a fine on a player who has already been
            fined for the conduct constituting the reason for the levy;
            or
      
        (7) it attempts to levy a fine on a zombie for an action that
            its master performed on its behalf.
      
        If the Referee attempts to levy three or more INEFFECTIVE fines
        in a week, any player CAN, with two support, issue a writ of
        Impartial Arbitration Restoration, immediately making the
        position of Referee vacant. When a writ of Impartial Arbitration
        Restoration is issued, the ADoP SHALL initiate an election for
        the Referee within a timely fashion.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Calls for Judgement
   What if there is a rule conflict? What if we can't decide what a rule
   means? Well then, it's time to call a CFJ.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 991/30 (Power=2)
Calls for Judgement

      Any person (the initiator) can initiate a Call for Judgement (CFJ,
      syn. Judicial Case), specifying a statement to be inquired into by
      announcement.
      
      When a person initiates a Call for Judgement, e CAN optionally bar
      one person from the case by announcement.
      
      At any time, each CFJ is either open (default), suspended, or
      assigned exactly one judgement.
      
      The Arbitor is an office, responsible for the administration of
      justice in a manner that is fair for emself, if not for the rest
      of Agora.
      
      Judge is an untracked CFJ switch with possible values of any
      person or "unassigned" (default).  To "assign" a CFJ to a person
      is to flip that CFJ's judge to that person.  To "remove" or
      "recuse" a person from a being the judge of a CFJ is to flip that
      CFJ's judge from that person to unassigned.
      
      When a CFJ's judge is unassigned, the Arbitor CAN assign any
      eligible player to be its judge by announcement, and SHALL do so
      in a timely fashion. The players eligible to be assigned as judge
      are all active players except the initiator and the person barred
      (if any). The Arbitor SHALL assign judges over time such that all
      interested players have reasonably equal opportunities to judge.
      If a CFJ has no judge assigned, then any player eligible to judge
      that CFJ CAN assign it to emself Without 3 Objections.
      
      The Arbitor's weekly report includes a summary of recent judicial
      case activity, including open and recently-judged cases, recent
      judicial assignments, and a list of players interested in judging.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 591/45 (Power=1.7)
Delivering Judgements

      When a CFJ is open and assigned to a judge, that judge CAN assign
      a valid judgement to it by announcement, and SHALL do so in a
      timely fashion after this becomes possible. If e does not, the
      Arbitor CAN remove em from being the judge of that case by
      announcement, and SHALL do so in a timely fashion after the time
      limit expires, unless the judge assigns a valid judgement in the
      mean time.
      
      The valid judgements for an inquiry case are as follows, based on
      the facts and legal situation at the time the inquiry case was
      initiated, not taking into account any events since that time:
      
      * FALSE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
        logically false
      
      * TRUE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
        logically true
      
      * IRRELEVANT, appropriate if the veracity of the statement is
        not relevant to the game or is an overly hypothetical
        extrapolation of the game or its rules to conditions that don't
        actually exist, or if it can be trivially determined from the
        outcome of another (possibly still undecided) judicial case that
        was not itself judged IRRELEVANT
      
      * INSUFFICIENT, appropriate if the statement does not come
        with supporting arguments or evidence, and the judge feels as if
        an undue burden is being placed on em by the lack of arguments
        and evidence. A CFJ judged as INSUFFICIENT CAN and SHOULD be
        submitted again with sufficient arguments/evidence.
      
      * DISMISS, appropriate if the statement is malformed, undecidable,
        if insufficient information exists to make a judgement with
        reasonable effort, or the statement is otherwise not able to be
        answered with another valid judgement. DISMISS is not
        appropriate if PARADOXICAL is appropriate.
      
      * PARADOXICAL, appropriate if the statement is logically
        undecidable as a result of a paradox or or other irresovable
        logical situation. PARADOXICAL is not appropriate if IRRELEVANT
        is appropriate, nor is it appropriate if the undecidability
        arises from the case itself or in reference to it.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 911/54 (Power=1.7)
Motions and Moots

      If a judgement has been in effect for less then seven days and has
      not been entered into Moot, then:
      
      - The judge of that CFJ CAN self-file a Motion to Reconsider the
        case by announcement, if e has not already self-filed a Motion
        to Reconsider that CFJ.
      - Any Player CAN group-file a Motion to Reconsider the case with 2
        Support, if the CFJ has not had a Motion to Reconsider
        group-filed for it at any time while it has been assigned to its
        current judge.
      
      When a Motion to Reconsider is so filed, the case is rendered open
      again.
      
      If a CFJ has a judgement assigned, a player CAN enter that
      judgement into Moot with N+2 support, where N is the number of
      weeks since that judgement has been assigned, rounded down. When
      this occurs, the CFJ is suspended, and the Arbitor is once
      authorized to initiate the Agoran decision to determine public
      confidence in the judgement, which e SHALL do in a timely fashion.
      
      For this decision, the vote collector is the Arbitor and the valid
      options are AFFIRM, REMAND, and REMIT. When the decision is
      resolved, the effect depends on the outcome:
      
      - AFFIRM, FAILED QUORUM: The judgement is reassigned to the case,
        and cannot be entered into Moot again.
      
      - REMAND: The case becomes open again.
      
      - REMIT: The case becomes open again, and the current judge is
        recused. The Arbitor SHALL NOT assign em to the case again
        unless no other eligible judges have displayed interest in
        judging.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2175/9 (Power=1)
Judicial Retraction and Excess

      A new case is a judicial case that has not had any judge assigned
      to it. The initiator of a new case CAN retract it by announcement,
      thus causing it to cease to be a judicial case.
      
      An excess case is a new case whose initiator previously initiated
      five or more cases during the same week as that case. A person
      SHALL NOT initiate an excess case. The Arbitor CAN refuse an
      excess case by announcement, thus causing it to cease to be a
      judicial case. When e does so, e fulfills any obligations with
      regards to that case.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2492/3 (Power=1)
Recusal

      A judge CAN recuse emself from a CFJ e is assigned to by
      announcement. When a judge recuses emself from a CFJ, then
      
      * the CFJ becomes unassigned;
      
      * the recused judge becomes ineligible to be assigned as a judge
      * for a week; and
      
      * the recused judge SHOULD suggest another judge for the CFJ to
      * make the Arbitor's job easier.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2246/6 (Power=2)
Submitting a CFJ to the Referee

      When a person initiates a Call for Judgement, e CAN, optionally,
      submit it to the Referee by announcement. All persons are
      ENCOURAGED to submit a case to the Referee only when there is a
      good reason not to let it be processed by the Arbitor as usual.
      
      When a CFJ is submitted to the Referee, the Referee receives all
      obligations and powers for the specific case that the Arbitor
      would otherwise receive due to being Arbitor.  This takes
      precedence over Rules that would otherwise assign duties and
      powers regarding a judicial case to the Arbitor.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Obligations & Contracts
   Agreements, promises, treaties, whatever you call them. This section
   contains rules which can bind players to obligations, in the form of
   Pledges and Contracts.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2471/1 (Power=1)
No Faking

      A person SHALL NOT make a public statement that is a lie. A
      statment is a lie if its publisher either knew or believed it to
      be not to be true at the time e published it (or, in the case of
      an action, not to be effective), and it was made with the intent
      to mislead. Merely quoting a statement does not constitute making
      it for the purposes of this rule. Any disclaimer, conditional
      clause, or other qualifier attached to a statement constitutes
      part of the statement for the purposes of this rule; the truth or
      falsity of the whole is what is significant.
      
      The previous provisions of this rule notwithstanding, a formal
      announcement of intent is never a lie.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2450/5 (Power=1.7)
Pledges

      If a Player makes a clear public pledge (syn. Oath) to perform (or
      refrain from performing) certain actions, then breaking the pledge
      within the pledge's time window is the Class N crime of
      Oathbreaking, where N is 2 unless the pledge explicitly states
      otherwise.  The time window of a pledge is 60 days, unless the
      pledge explicitly states otherwise.
      
      If breaking the pledge harms specific other parties, the Referee
      SHOULD solicit the opinion of those parties in determining an
      appropriate fine.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2466/1 (Power=3)
Acting on Behalf

      When a rule allows one person (the agent) to act on behalf of
      another (the principal) to perform an action, that agent CAN
      perform the action if it is POSSIBLE for the principal to do so,
      taking into account any prerequisites for the action. If the
      enabling rule does not specify the mechanism by which the agent
      may do so, then the agent CAN perform the action in the same
      manner in which the principal CAN do so, with the additional
      requirement that the agent must, in the message in which the
      action is performed, uniquely identify the principal and that the
      action is being taken on behalf of that person.
      
      A person SHALL NOT act on behalf of another person if doing so
      causes the second person to violate the rules. A person CANNOT act
      on behalf of another person to do anything except perform a game
      action; in particular, a person CANNOT act on behalf of another
      person to send a message, only to perform specific actions that
      might be taken within a message.
      
      When an action is performed on behalf of a principal, then the
      action is considered for all game purposes to have been performed
      by the principal, unless a rule specifically states that it is
      treated differently for some purpose, in which case it is treated
      as described by that rule.
      
      Allowing a person to act on behalf of another person is secured at
      power 2.0. This rule takes precedence over any rule that would
      prohibit a person from taking an action, except that it defers to
      any rule that imposes limitations specifically on actions taken on
      behalf of another person.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2519/0 (Power=3)
Consent

      A person gives consent (syn. consents) to an action when e, acting
      as emself, publicly states that e agrees to the action. This
      agreement may be implied, but only if it is reasonably clear from
      context that the person wanted the agreement to take place.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1742/21 (Power=2.5)
Contracts

      Any group of two or more consenting persons (the parties) may
      make an agreement among themselves with the intention that it be
      binding upon them and be governed by the rules. Such an agreement
      is known as a contract. A contract may be modified, including
      by changing the set of parties, by agreement between all existing
      parties. A contract may also terminate by agreement between all
      parties. A contract automatically terminates if the number of
      parties to it falls below two. It is IMPOSSIBLE for a person to
      become a party to a contract without eir agreement. For the
      purposes of this rule, agreement includes both consent and
      agreement specified by contract.
      
      Parties to a contract governed by the rules SHALL act in
      accordance with that contract. This obligation is not impaired
      by contradiction between the contract and any other contract, or
      between the contract and the rules.
      
      A party to a contract CAN perform any of the following actions
      as permitted by the contract's text:
      
      * Act on behalf of another party to the contract.
      
      * By announcement, revoke destructible assets from the contract.
      
      * By announcement, take liquid assets from the contract.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Assets
   Assets are things players can own. This section describes how that
   works.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2166/28 (Power=3)
Assets

      An asset is an entity defined as such by a document that has been
      granted Mint Authority by the Rules (hereafter the asset's backing
      document), and existing solely because its backing document
      defines its existence. An asset's backing document can generally
      specify when and how that asset is created, destroyed, and
      transferred.
      
      The rules collectively have Mint Authority. Contracts have Mint
      Authority. A rule defined asset is public; one defined by a
      contract is private.
      
      The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity (if any)
      defined as such by, and bound by, its backing document. That
      entity's report includes a list of all instances of that class and
      their owners. This portion of that entity's report is
      self-ratifying.
      
      For a class of assets to be "tracked by" an entity is for that
      entity to be its recordkeepor.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2576/0 (Power=3)
Ownership

      Each asset has exactly one owner. If an asset's backing document
      restricts its ownership to a class of entities, then that asset
      CANNOT be gained by or transferred to an entity outside that
      class, and is destroyed if it is owned by an entity outside that
      class. The restrictions in the previous sentence are subject to
      modification by its backing document. By default, ownership of an
      asset is restricted to Agora, players, and contracts.
      
      If an asset would otherwise lack an owner, it is owned by the Lost
      and Found Department. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the
      Lost and Found Department can own assets of every type. Assets
      owned by the Lost and Found Department can be transferred or
      destroyed by any player without objection.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2577/2 (Power=3)
Asset Actions

      An asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner by announcement,
      subject to modification by its backing document. An indestructible
      asset is one defined as such by its backing document, and CANNOT
      be destroyed except as explicitly specified by its backing
      document; any other asset is destructible.
      
      For an entity to earn an asset is for that asset to be created in
      that entity's possession. To grant an entity an asset is to create
      it in eir possession.
      
      For an entity to lose an asset is for that asset to be destroyed
      from that entity's possession. To revoke an asset from an entity
      is to destroy it from that entity's possession.
      
      For entity A to take an asset from entity B is to transfer it from
      entity B to entity A.
      
      An asset generally CAN be transferred (syn. given) by announcement
      by its owner to another entity, subject to modification by its
      backing document. A fixed asset is one defined as such by its
      backing document, and CANNOT be transferred; any other asset is
      liquid.
      
      When a rule indicates transferring an amount that is not a natural
      number, the specified amount is rounded up to the nearest natural
      number.

Rule 2578/1 (Power=3)
Currencies

      A currency is a class of asset defined as such by its backing
      document. Instances of a currency with the same owner are
      fungible.
      
      The "x balance of an entity", where x is a currency, is the number
      of x that entity possesses. Where it resolves ambiguity, the asset
      or currency being referred to is the currency designated as
      the official currency of Agora, if there is one.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2579/0 (Power=3)
Fee-based Actions

      If the Rules associate payment of a set of assets (hereafter
      the fee for the action; syns: cost, price, charge) with performing
      an action, that action is a fee-based action.
      
      If the fee is a non-integer quantity of a fungible asset, the
      actual fee is the next highest integer amount of that asset.
      
      To perform a fee-based action, an entity (the Actor) who is
      otherwise permitted to perform the action must announce that e is
      performing the action; the announcement must specify the correct
      set of assets for the fee and indicate intent to pay that fee for
      the sole purpose of performing the action.
      
      Upon such an announcement:
      
        - If the Rules specify a recipient for the fee, and the Actor
          CAN transfer that specified fee from emself to the recipient,
          then that fee is transferred from the Actor to the recipient
          and the action is performed simultaneously;
      
        - If the Rules do not specify a recipient, and the Actor CAN
          destroy the specified fee in eir possession, then that fee in
          eir possession is destroyed and the action is performed
          simultaneously.
      
        - Otherwise, no changes are made to asset holdings and the
          action is not performed.
      
      If the Rules define a fee-based action but the specified set of
      assets is the empty set, then the action can be performed by
      announcement, but the announcement must include that there is an
      (empty or 0) fee for the action.

Rule 2496/14 (Power=1)
Rewards

      A player CAN, by announcement, earn the set of assets associated
      with a reward condition exactly once in a timely fashion each time
      e fulfills it, provided the announcement specifies the action that
      e performed and the amount of assets e earns as a result.
      
      Below is a list of reward conditions and their associated assets.
      
      * Being the author of an adopted proposal: a number of coins equal
        to ((the total number of valid ballots cast FOR the decision -
        the total number of valid ballots cast AGAINST) times the
        adoption index of the result) rounded up.
      
      * Judging a CFJ that e was assigned to without violating a time
        limit to do so: 5 coins.
      
      * Publishing an office's weekly or monthly report, provided that
        publication was the first report published for that office in
        the relevant time period (week or month respectively) to fulfill
        an official weekly or monthly duty: 5 coins.
      
      * Resolving an Agoran Decision on whether to adopt a proposal,
        provided that no other Agoran Decision on whether to adopt that
        or any other proposal had been resolved earlier in that Agoran
        week: 5 coins.
      
      * Having a Thesis pass peer-review and be granted a Degree based

      1. Each player first earns 10 coins; then
      
      2. For each office, if a single player held that office for 16 or
         more days in the previous month and no unforgivable fines were
         levied on em for eir conduct in that office during that time,
         that player earns 5 coins.
      
      The occurrence of Paydays is secured.  At the beginning of each

Auctions
   If you want to give out assets, this is the section to look at.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2545/2 (Power=2)
Auctions

      An Auction is a way for entities to give away items in exchange
      for a currency. Any rule CAN permit or require Auctions to be
      initiated.
      
      Each Auction has one or more lots of items. A lot is a non-empty
      list of items to be transferred to a single recipient.
      
      Each Auction has an Auctioneer. All rules permitting Auctions to
      be initiated should specify an entity to be Auctioneer. If no
      Auctioneer is specified, the default Auctioneer is Agora.
      
      Each Auction has an Announcer. Only persons can be Announcers. If
      the Auctioneer of an Auction is a player, then that player is also
      the Announcer of that Auction. Otherwise, the rule defining an
      Auction CAN define the Announcer for that Auction.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2549/4 (Power=1)
Auction Initiation

      An entity authorized by a rule to initiate an Auction CAN do so by
      announcement. If the rule specifies that that entity MUST do so,
      that entity SHALL do so in a timely fashion. An Auction CANNOT be
      initiated other than as described by a rule.
      
      An Auction CANNOT be initiated unless the announcer specifies all
      of
      
      * the Auction's lots, in the order they will be awarded,
      
      * the items in each lot,
      
      * the Auction's Auctioneer,
      
      * the Auction's Announcer,
      
      * the Auction's minimum bid, and, optionally
      
      * the Auction's currency
      
      in the message initiating the Auction. An Auction also CANNOT be
      initiated unless the Auctioneer is able to give away each item in
      each of the Auction's lots.
      
      If no currency is specified, it defaults to the official currency
      of Agora.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2550/1 (Power=1)
Bidding

      A person authorized to bid on an Auction CAN do so by
      announcement, specifying the amount of the Auction's currency to
      bid. A bid placed on an Auction before it is initiated, or after
      it has ended, is INEFFECTIVE.
      
      An attempt to place a bid which is less than the Auction's minimum
      bid is INEFFECTIVE.
      
      A person CAN withdraw their bid on an Auction by announcement. If
      a person submits a bid on an Auction, all bids previously placed
      on that Auction by that person are withdrawn.
      
      A rule defining an Auction CAN specify a class of players who are
      authorized to bid on that Auction. If the rule  does not specify a
      class of authorized bidders, any player is authorized to bid on an
      Auction defined by a rule.
      
      A person SHALL NOT bid on an Auction if it would be impossible for
      em to pay that amount at the conclusion of the Auction.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2551/3 (Power=1)
Auction End

      An Auction ends 7 days after its initiation, or immediately if no
      bid has been placed or withdrawn in the last 96 hours, or
      immediately if it is terminated.
      
      When an Auction ends, any bid placed by an entity which does not
      own enough of the Auction's currency to pay the amount specified
      in the bid is automatically withdrawn.
      
      Once an Auction has ended, any further attempts to bid on that
      Auction or to withdraw bids from that Auction are INEFFECTIVE.
      
      Once the Auction has ended, the Auction's announcer SHALL announce
      the end of the Auction in a timely fashion. In the same message, e
      SHALL include the a list of all the bids on the Auction and the
      winner(s) (if there are any) of the Auction.
      
      A person's priority on an Auction is their position in the list of
      persons who have bid on the Auction, sorted by the value of their
      non-withdrawn bids in descending order. If two persons have placed
      non-withdrawn bids for the same value, a player who placed their
      non-withdrawn bid first has a higher priority than a player who
      placed their non-withdrawn bid at a later time.
      
      For each lot in the Auction, the winner of that lot is the player
      with the highest priority on the Auction who has not won any
      previous lot. If there are more lots than there are persons with
      non-withdrawn bids, the excess lots are not won by any person.
      
      The winner of the lot SHALL, in a timely fashion, pay a fee (the
      number of the Auction's currency equal to eir bid) to the
      Auctioneer in order to satisfy eir auction debt. When e does so,
      if the auctioneer CAN transfer the items in that lot to that
      winner at will, e immediately does so; otherwise, e SHALL do so in
      a timely fashion.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2552/0 (Power=1)
Auction Termination

      Any player CAN terminate an Auction, by announcement, if the
      Auction has not ended and the Auctioneer of that Auction cannot
      transfer any item included in a lot in that Auction.
      
      When an Auction is terminated, all bids on that Auction are

Rule 2532/3 (Power=2)
Zombies

      Master is a secured player switch with possible values of any
      player, and Agora. Every player's default master is emself; rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding, a player CAN always flip eir own
      master to emself by announcement.
      
      A player whose master is not emself is a zombie (syn. inactive);
      all other players are active.  A zombie's master, if another
      player, is allowed to act on behalf of the zombie (i.e. as the
      zombie's agent), except a master CANNOT act on behalf of a zombie
      to:
        - initiate, support, object to, or perform a dependent action;
        - act on behalf of that zombie's zombies;
        - bid in a zombie auction;
        - enter a contract, pledge, or other type of agreement;
        - initiate a Call for Judgement;
        - deregister.
      
      A zombie's master CAN flip that zombie's master switch to Agora by
      announcement.
      
      If a master causes a zombie to perform an ILLEGAL action, the
      master commits the Class 4+N Crime of Masterminding (where N is
      the class of the illegal action).
      
      If a active player who was a zombie has not received a Welcome
      Package since e most recently ceased being a zombie, and if eir
      resale value was less than 2 at any point during eir most recent
      time as a zombie, then any player CAN cause em to receive a
      Welcome Package by announcement.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2574/2 (Power=3)
Zombie Life Cycle

      Any player CAN, with Notice, flip the master switch of an active
      player who has not made a public announcement in the past 60 days
      to Agora.
      
      Resale value is a secured natural switch for zombies, tracked by
      the Registrar, with a default value of 2. Whenever a zombie's
      master switch is flipped to a player other than emself, eir resale
      value is decreased by 1. At the end of a zombie auction, every
      zombie that is an excess lot in that auction has eir resale value
      decreased by 1.
      
      A zombie with a resale value of 0 CANNOT have eir master switch
      flipped to a player other than emself, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding.
      
      Any player CAN, with Notice:
        - If a zombie has been a zombie for the past 90 days and not had
          Agora for a master during any of that time, flip the zombie's
          master switch to Agora;
        - If a player is master to more than one zombie, flip the master
          switch of one of that master's zombies to Agora;
        - Deregister a zombie whose master is Agora and who has a resale
          value of 0.
      
      The Registrar SHALL track the date that each zombie last belonged
      to Agora in eir weekly report.  The Registrar SHALL perform all
      POSSIBLE actions in the preceding paragraph in a timely fashion
      after first reporting their possibility via the facts in eir
      weekly report.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1885/9 (Power=2)
Zombie Auctions

      Whenever a zombie (1) has Agora for a master, (2) is not a lot in
      an ongoing auction, (3) has a resale value greater than 0, and (4)
      has not been won as an auction lot in the past 14 days, then the
      Registrar CAN put that zombie (along with any other zombies that
      fulfill the same conditions) up for auction.
      
      In a timely fashion after the beginning of each month, the
      Registrar SHALL either initiate such an auction or, if no zombies
      meeting these conditions existed at the beginning of the month,
      announce that no such auction is necessary.
      
      For such an auction, the lots are the qualifying zombies, ordered
      at the discretion of the Registrar. The Registrar is the
      announcer, and the minimum bid is 1.  Rules  to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the master of a zombie CANNOT bid in a zombie
      auction. If a player becomes a zombie's master, all eir bids in
      zombie auctions that have not ended are withdrawn. For the purpose
      of such a auction, to transfer a zombie to a player is to set that
      zombie's master switch to that player.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, if a player's master switch
      is flipped while a zombie auction in which e is a lot is ongoing,
      then the winner of that lot NEED NOT pay Agora eir bid and Agora
      CANNOT and NEED NOT transfer the contents of the lot to the
      winner.

Sectors

      Sectors are entities; each Sector has an ID number, which is (the
      number of existent sectors that were created before it + 1).
      
      Creating, destroying or altering Sectors is secured.
      
      If no Spaceship is in a particular Sector, then that Sector is
      "empty"; otherwise it is "occupied".
      
      Two Sectors are "adjacent" if their IDs differ by exactly 1. If a
      sector exists with an ID equivalent to the current month of the
      year, and a sector exists with an ID equivalent to the current day

Rule 2591/2 (Power=1)
Spaceships

      Spaceships are a class of fixed asset, tracked by the Astronomor,
      with ownership restricted to players. The following are Spaceship
      switches, tracked by the Astronomor:
      
      * Location (possible values any Sector, defaulting to the Sector
        with the lowest ID number);
      
      * Armour (an integer switch limited to values less than or equal
        to 10, defaulting to 10).
      
      A Spaceship is "in" its Location. For a Spaceship to "move" to a
      Sector is for its Location to be flipped to that Sector. When a
      player registers, a Spaceship is created in eir possession. When a
      Spaceship is created, it immediately moves to the lowest-numbered
      empty Sector, if any.
      
      A Spaceship with an Armour of 0 or less is "Defeated". A
      Spaceship is "Pilotable" if it is neither Defeated nor engaging
      in a Space Battle.
      
      Any player CAN, by announcement, spend a coin to increase the
      Armour of a Pilotable Spaceship e owns by 1. This is called
      "Repairing" the Spaceship.
      
      If a player does not have a spaceship in eir possession e CAN, by
      announcement, create a spaceship in eir posession.

Rule 2592/0 (Power=1)
Spaceship Energy

      Energy is a fixed currency, tracked by the Astronomor, with

      balance exceeds 20, any excess Energy it possesses is destroyed.
      
      When a Spaceship is created, 20 Energy is created in its
      possession.
      
      At the start of each Agoran day, each Pilotable Spaceship gains 2
      Energy. Any player also CAN, by announcement, pay 2 coins to grant
      a Pilotable Spaceship e owns 1 Energy.
      
      Any player CAN, by announcement, cause a Pilotable Spaceship e
      owns to pay 1 Energy to move to a Sector adjacent to its Location.

Rule 2593/3 (Power=1)
Space Battles

      Two players are "allied" if they agree to be allied or if one is
      the master of the other; otherwise they are "opponents". For the
      purposes of this rule, agreement includes both consent and
      agreement specified by contract.
      
      A player who owns a Pilotable Spaceship in the same Sector as one
      of eir opponents' Pilotable Spaceships CAN, by announcement,
      initiate a Space Battle between the two Spaceships. These two
      players are the "combatants" of the Space Battle, and the two
      Spaceships are then "engaging" in the Space Battle until it is
      resolved.
      
      A Space Battle CANNOT be initiated if either of the two involved
      Spaceships has been engaging in a Space Battle within the last 24
      hours or if the prior Space Battle the spaceship initiating the
      Space Battle has been in was against the spaceship it is
      attacking.
      
      The resolver for a Space Battle is the player highest in the
      following list at the time of the Space Battle's initiation who is
      not a combatant in the Space Battle:
      
      1) the Astronomor;
      2) the Arbitor;
      3) the Prime Minister;
      4) the non-combatant active player who has least recently
         registered.
      
      For the initiation of a Space Battle to be EFFECTIVE, the
      initiator must correctly specify the resolver.
      
      In a timely fashion after a Space Battle is initiated, the
      combatants SHOULD each once communicate to the resolver the amount
      of Energy they wish to spend in the battle, via any method that
      cannot be understood by the other combatant until e has also
      fulfilled this obligation. For example:
      
      * by publishing a salted cryptographic hash, and revealing its
        text after the other combatant has also communicated the Energy
        e will spend;
      * by sending the amount to the resolver in a private message;
      * by publishing the amount, if the other combatant has already
        communicated the Energy e will spend.
      
      For the resolver to reveal the Energy a combatant is spending
      before both combatants have made their decisions is the Class-5
      Crime of Violating General Relativity.
      
      After both combatants have communicated the Energy they will
      spend, or if the time limit to do so has expired, the resolver
      CAN, and SHALL in a timely fashion, resolve the Space Battle by
      announcing the changes in each Spaceship's Energy balance and
      Armour (described below), and the Winner (if any) of the Space
      Battle.
      
      When a Space Battle is resolved:
      
      1) N Energy is revoked from each Spaceship, where N is the lesser
         of the Spaceship's Energy balance and the amount of Energy
         decided on by the Spaceship's owner, or 0 if the Spaceship's
         owner failed to do so;
      2) each Spaceship's Armour is decreased by X, where X is the
         lesser of the Spaceship's Armour and the amount of Energy
         revoked from the other Spaceship;
      3) the Winner of the Space Battle is the combatant, if any, whose
         Spaceship's Armour was reduced by a smaller amount than the
         other Spaceship's.

      positive Fame are "Famous", and those with negative Fame are
      "Infamous".
      
      If a player is the Winner in a Space Battle against an Infamous
      player, eir Fame is increased by 1. Likewise, if a player is the
      Winner in a Space Battle against a Famous player or one with a
      Fame of 0, eir Fame is decreased by 1.
      
      Any player whose Fame is either 10 or -10 CAN win the game With 2
      Days Notice.

Victory & Karma
   All games have winners, and Agora is no exception. If you're
   interested in getting some serious bragging points among the Agorans,
   this is the right place to look.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2449/3 (Power=3)
Winning the Game

      When the Rules state that a person or persons win the game, those
      persons win the game; specifically they win the Round that ends
      with the indicated win. Agora itself does not end and the ruleset
      remains unchanged. The Herald is then authorized to award those
      persons the Patent Title of Champion once, by announcement.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2465/0 (Power=0.3)
Victory by Apathy

      A player CAN Declare Apathy without objection, specifying a set of
      players. Upon doing so, the specified players win the game.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2510/4 (Power=1)
Such is Karma

      Karma is a person switch tracked by the Herald in eir Weekly
      Report. Karma is an Integer switch. Agora also has an instance of
      the Karma switch.
      
      A player CAN publish a Notice of Honour. For a Notice of Honour
      to be valid, it must:
      
      1. Be clear that it is a Notice of Honour, and be the first valid
         Notice of Honour that player has published in the current week;
      
      2. Specify any other player or Agora to gain karma, and provide a
         reason for specifying that player; and
      
      3. Specify any player or Agora to lose karma, and provide a reason
         for specifying that player.
      
      4. Not result in Agora's karma moving farther away from 0.
      
      When a valid Notice of Honour is published, the entity specified
      to gain karma has eir karma increased by one, and the entity
      specified to lose karma has eir karma decreased by one. Raising
      one entity's karma while lowering another's in this manner is
      considered to be a "transfer" of karma.
      
      A player's positions in Court are defined as follows:
      
      - Any player with a karma of 5 or greater is a Samurai.
      
      - Any player with a karma of -5 or less is an Gamma.
      
      - The Samurai with the highest karma (if any) is the Shogun.
      
      - The Gamma with the lowest karma (if any) is the Honourless
        Worm.
      
      Each player's positions in Court are part of of the Herald's
      Weekly Report.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2511/2 (Power=1)
Karmic Balance

      In a timely fashion after the beginning of each Quarter, the
      Herald CAN and SHALL by announcement, perform the following tasks
      in order:
      
      1. Halve (rounding towards 0) the Karma of every Unregistered
         person.
      
      2. Set the Karma of Agora such that the sum of all Karma switch
         instance values in the game is equal to 0.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2553/0 (Power=1)
Win by Paradox

      If a CFJ about the legality or possibility of a game action, has
      been assigned a judgment of PARADOXICAL continuously for at least
      7 days, and e has not done so already in respect of that CFJ, then
      that case's initiator CAN, by announcement, win the game.
      
      A player who wins in this fashion SHOULD submit a proposal to
      prevent the paradox from arising again.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Awards
   Even if it's not a win, there are still a good few opportunities to
   win bragging points, like Ribbons and Patent Titles.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2438/9 (Power=3)
Ribbons

      The Tailor is an office, and the recordkeepor of Ribbons.
      
      Ribbon Ownership is a person switch, tracked by the Tailor in eir
      monthly report, whose values are the subsets of the set of types
      of Ribbon, defaulting to the empty set. If the rules are amended
      to change the types of Ribbon, if a player's Ribbon Ownership is
      subsequently illegal, then it is updated by removing all
      nonexistent types rather than resetting the entire value to
      default.
      
      To "award a person a <Ribbon type>" is to add that type of Ribbon
      to that person's Ribbon Ownership. A person "owns a <Ribbon type>"
      if that type of Ribbon is an element of eir Ribbon Ownership.
      
      While a person qualifies for a type of Ribbon, any player CAN, by
      announcement, award em that type of Ribbon. A person qualifies for
      a type of Ribbon if e has earned that type of Ribbon within the
      preceding 7 days (including earlier in the same message) and has
      not owned that type of Ribbon within the preceding 7 days.
      
      While a person owns all types of Ribbon, that person can Raise a
      Banner by announcement. This causes that person to win the game.
      That person's Ribbon Ownership becomes the empty set.
      
      The types of Ribbon, and the methods of obtaining them, are as
      follows:
      
      Red (R): When a proposal is adopted and changes at least one rule
      with Power >= 3, its proposer earns a Red Ribbon.
      
      Orange (O): When a proposal is adopted via an Agoran Decision on
      which no valid ballots were AGAINST (after evaluating
      conditionals), its proposer earns an Orange Ribbon.
      
      Green (G): While a person has held an elected office continuously
      for 30 days, and has not failed to perform any duties of that
      office within the appropriate time limits during those 30 days,
      that person qualifies for a Green Ribbon.
      
      Cyan (C): When a person deputises for an office, that person earns
      a Cyan Ribbon.
      
      Blue (B): When a person assigns a judgement to a CFJ, and has
      never violated a time limit to assign a judgement to that CFJ,
      that person earns a Blue Ribbon.
      
      Magenta (M): During Agora's Birthday, each person who has publicly
      acknowledged the fact qualifies for a Magenta Ribbon.
      
      Ultraviolet (U): When a person is awarded the Patent Title
      Champion, that person earns an Ultraviolet Ribbon.
      
      Violet (V): When a person is awarded a Patent Title other than
      Champion or a degree, that person earns a Violet Ribbon.
      
      Indigo (I): When a person is awarded a degree, that person earns
      an Indigo Ribbon.
      
      Platinum (P): The Speaker qualifies for a Platinum Ribbon.
      
      Lime (L): A person qualifies for a Lime Ribbon if three or more
      proposals adopted in the preceding 7 days had that person as a
      coauthor.
      
      White (W): A player qualifies for a White Ribbon if e has never
      previously owned a White Ribbon (including under previous
      rulesets). A player who has been registered for at least 30 days
      and has never caused another person to gain a White Ribbon
      (including under a previous ruleset) CAN award a White Ribbon to
      another person by announcement.
      
      Black (K): This rule does not specify any methods of obtaining
      Black Ribbons.
      
      Gray (A): The Tailor CAN award a Gray Ribbon by announcement,
      unless e has done so earlier in the month. E is ENCOURAGED to
      award such a Ribbon in the same message in which e publishes eir
      monthly report.
      
      Transparent (T): A person qualifies for a Transparent Ribbon while
      the number of other types of Ribbon that that person qualifies for
      and/or has earned within the previous 7 days is at least 5.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2480/2 (Power=2.1)
Festivals

      Festivity is a singleton switch, whose possible values are
      integers ranging from 0 inclusive to the number of defined types
      of Ribbon exclusive, and defaulting to 0. While Agora's Festivity
      is 0, Festivity is tracked in the Tailor's monthly report.
      Otherwise, it is tracked in the Tailor's weekly report. Changes to
      Festivity are secured.
      
      If Agora's Festivity has had the same nonzero value for 14 days or
      more, or if it has a nonzero value and fewer than 5 players are
      Festive, then any player CAN flip it to 0 by announcement.
      
      A player who owns at least N types of Ribbon CAN Start a Rank N
      Festival, where N is an integer greater than Agora's Festivity,
      with 4 Support from players who own at least N types of Ribbon.
      Upon doing so, Agora's Festivity is flipped to N. Exception: A
      player CANNOT do so if Agora's Festivity has had a value greater
      than or equal to N within the past 21 days.
      
      A person who owns a number of types of Ribbon equal to or greater
      than Agora's Festivity is known as Festive. Other persons are not
      Festive.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2481/1 (Power=2.1)
Festival Restrictions

      While Agora's Festivity is nonzero, the following apply:
      
      1. Non-Festive players are never considered Supporters of a
         dependent action;
      
      2. Non-Festive players cannot flip the Imminence of any proposal;
      
      3. Quorum for Agoran Decisions is equal to half the number of
         Festive players, rounded up;
      
      4. Each Festive player has the maximum possible voting strength.
         All other players have the minimum possible voting strength.
      
      While Agora's Festivity is zero, the paragraphs above have no
      effect and are ignored.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 649/40 (Power=1.5)
Patent Titles

      A Patent Title is a legal title given to a person in recognition
      of the person's distinction. The Herald is an office; its holder
      is responsible for tracking Patent Titles in eir monthly report.
      
      Awarding or revoking a Patent Title is secured at power 1. A
      person permitted and enabled to award (revoke) a Patent Title
      SHALL do so in a timely fashion after the conditions authorizing
      em to do so are announced, unless there is an open judicial case
      contesting the validity of those conditions.
      
      The Herald CAN award a specified Patent Title to a specified
      player With 2 Agoran Consent.
      
      If a player publicly petitions that the Herald award a patent
      title to another player for a specified reason, the Herald SHALL
      respond in a timely fashion by either attempting to grant an
      appropriate patent title or explaining publicly why no patent
      title is warranted.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2415/0 (Power=1.5)
Badges

      A Badge is any patent title with the word 'badge' as part of its
      name. A badge SHOULD be used to award multiple persons for
      participating in specific event of note within Agora.  Any player
      CAN award a badge that does not yet exist to three or more persons
      simultaneously, with Agoran Consent. The Herald CAN award an
      existing badge to persons Without Objection.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1367/20 (Power=3)
Degrees

      Certain patent titles are known as degrees. The degrees are
      
      - Associate of Nomic                 (A.N.)
      - Juris Doctor of Nomic              (J.N.)
      - Bachelor of Nomic                  (B.N.)

      Degrees are ranked in the order they appear in this rule, with
      degrees listed later being ranked higher. A specific degree CANNOT
      be awarded to any person more than once.
      
      A specified degree CAN be awarded with 2 Agoran Consent, and
      SHOULD only be awarded for the publication of an original thesis
      of scholarly worth (including responses to peer-review), published
      with explicit intent to qualify for a degree. The Herald SHOULD
      coordinate the peer-review process and the awarding of degrees.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2231/6 (Power=3)
Order of the Hero of Agora Nomic

      Heroic titles are Agora's premier patent titles of distinction,
      and CAN be awarded to persons for meritorious service only by a
      proposal of power 3 or greater, which SHOULD explain why those
      persons are qualified. Bearers of heroic titles (Heroes)
      constitute the Order of the Hero of Agora Nomic.
      
      The Heroic titles in decreasing precedence are:
      
      Grand Hero of Agora Nomic (GHAN) -- This title CAN be awarded to
      any person obviously and directly responsible for the existence of
      Agora and/or Nomic in general. As this title is the highest honour
      that Agora may bestow, a Bearer of this title OUGHT to be treated
      right good forever.
      
      Hero of Agora Nomic (HAN) -- This title CAN be awarded to any
      person for outstanding meritorious service to Agora above and
      beyond the call of duty.

Leaders
   Agora has a good few leaders, most of which are nothing more than
   sinecures. This section isn't all that important.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 103/25 (Power=2)
The Speaker

      The Speaker is an imposed office and the figurehead leader of
      Agora.
      
      The player or players who have most recently won the game are
      called Laureled. If at any time the office of Speaker is vacant,
      or when one or more players win Agora, then the Prime Minister CAN
      once appoint a Laureled player to the office of Speaker by
      announcement.  Whenever the Prime Minister CAN appoint a Laureled
      player to the office of Speaker, e SHALL do so in a timely manner,
      except that the Prime Minister MAY defer appointing a new Speaker
      while there is pending one or more open CFJs that could plausibly
      determine or affect the question of whether a player is Laureled.
      
      If the office of Speaker has been held continuously by the same
      person for 90+ days, then any player CAN appoint another player to
      the office with Support.
      
      For an election of the Prime Minister, the Speaker has voting
      strength one greater than e would have if e did not hold the
      office.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2423/3 (Power=2)
First Among Equals

      The Prime Minister is an office. The Prime Minister is elected by
      the players of Agora primarily on account of not being the other
      guy. The Prime Minister SHOULD ensure that Agoran affairs proceed
      smoothly.
      
      The holder of the office of Prime Minister's voting strength is
      increased by 1 on all Agoran decisions other than a elections of
      the Prime Minister.

        of a specified open case.
      
      - Dive (Referee): The Prime Minister levies a 2 Blot fine on a
        specified player. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the
        reason for the fine MAY be any grievance held by the Prime
        Minister, not necessarily a violation of the rules, against the
        person to whom the fine is levied.
      
      - Manifesto (Promotor): The Prime Minister distributes a specified
        proposal in the Proposal Pool.

Rule 1727/21 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;
      
      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial Rulesets
      of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets of Nomic
      World and other nomics,
      
      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June 30,
      1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by FIRST SPEAKER
      Michael Norrish, which read, in part,
      
        "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
        precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think we may
        as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules are invited.
        In accordance with the rules, these will be published, numbered
        and distributed by me at my earliest convenience."
      
      And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic,
      known unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was played
      on, until its Players, much later, gave it its OFFICIAL NAME of
      Agora,
      
      And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest, and
      most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the hard work
      and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent advice of
      Agoraphobes,
      
      And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
      founding,
      
      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year.

Rule 2464/4 (Power=1)
Tournaments

      A Tournament is a sub-game of Agora specifically sanctioned to be
      initiated as a tournament by the Rules. The person who initiates a
      tournament is its Gamemaster. If a winner of a tournament is
      determined within within 3 months of its initiation, that person
      or persons win the game, otherwise the tournament concludes with
      no winner.
      
      A Tournament is governed by set of regulations, created in
      accordance with its parent rule, which have binding control over
      those who freely consent to play the tournament and over the
      tournament itself. Once the tournament is concluded, these
      regulations cease to have any effect, and CAN be repealed by any
      player by announcement.
      
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2566/0 (Power=1)
Free Tournaments

      A player who is not the gamemaster of an existing tournament CAN
      initiate a sanctioned tournament with a specified set of
      regulations with 2 Agoran Consent. A tournament created using this
      method is called a Free Tournament. Rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, only players CAN win the game via a free
      tournament.
      
      A free tournament CAN be concluded with no winner without 3
      objections. Tournaments SHOULD only be concluded in this manner if
      it is clear that its regulations are malformed or contrary to the
      tournament's intent or that it is IMPOSSIBLE for any player to win
      the tournament.

Rule 2495/2 (Power=1)
The Birthday Tournament

      In a timely fashion after the start of June 1 of each year, the
      Herald SHALL propose a set of Regulations governing a Birthday
      Tournament for that year; the Herald CAN also delegate the
      responsibility for creating or running the tournament to another
      player, with that player's consent, by announcement.
      
      The Birthday Tournament's regulations SHOULD be such that all
      persons who choose to participate have a fair chance of winning
      the tournament (according to its regulations), and a winner
      SHOULD be expected within 2-3 weeks following the tournament's
      initiation.
      
      After adequate time for discussion of the Birthday Tournament's
      regulations, the Herald (or delegate) CAN initiate a sanctioned
      tournament, promulgating a specified, finalized set of tournament
      regulations, Without 3 Objections. This title may thereafter
      be amended only by the Herald or eir designee Without 3
      Objections. The initiation SHOULD be timed to coincide
      with Agora's Birthday.

      The period each year from midnight GMT on the morning of 24
      December to the beginning of the first Agoran week to begin after

      together with the following week, is a Holiday.
