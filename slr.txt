========================================================================
The Game of Agora
   This section includes a few rules concerning the Nature of the Game
   of Agora.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 101/17 (Power=4)
The Game of Agora

      Agora is a game of Nomic, wherein Persons, acting in accordance
      with the Rules, communicate their game Actions and/or results of
      these actions via Fora in order to play the game. The game may be
      won, but the game never ends.
      
      Please treat Agora Right Good Forever.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1698/7 (Power=4)
Agora Is A Nomic

      Agora is ossified if it is IMPOSSIBLE for any reasonable
      combination of actions by players to cause arbitrary rule changes
      to be made and/or arbitrary proposals to be adopted within a
      real-world (UTC) four-week period.
      
      If, but for this rule, the net effect of a proposal would cause
      Agora to become ossified, or would cause Agora to cease to exist,
      it cannot take effect, rules to the contrary notwithstanding. If
      any other single change or inseparable group of changes to the
      gamestate would cause Agora to become ossified, or would cause
      Agora to cease to exist, it is cancelled and does not occur, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Important Temporary Rules
   This category is a temporary dumping ground for rules that don't
   easily fit in any other category but that hold special relevance for
   the current gamestate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2683/1 (Power=0.5)
The Boulder

      The Absurdor is an office.
      
      The Boulder's Height is a singleton integer switch defaulting to
      0, tracked by the Absurdor.
      
      Each player CAN, once a week, by announcement, push the boulder.
      When a player pushes the Boulder, its Height is increased by 1.
      At the beginning of each week, if the boulder was not pushed in
      the previous week, the Boulder's Height is set to 0. The Absurdor
      SHOULD list the largest Height of the Boulder ever reached in eir
      report.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Players
   This small section provides some rules detailing how joining and
   leaving Agora works. If you're a new player, this is probably the
   most important section to read.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 869/52 (Power=3)
How to Join and Leave Agora

      Any entity (including a group of entities confederated with the
      intent of forming a single person under this Rule) that is or ever
      was able to willingly communicate original ideas is a person.
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no other entities are
      persons.
      
      Questions about personhood are to be resolved equitably, with
      regard for the good-faith of those involved and the customs of
      honorable play.
      
      Citizenship is a secured person switch with values Unregistered
      (default) and Registered, tracked by the Registrar. A registered
      person is a Player. To "register" someone is to flip that person's
      Citizenship switch from Unregistered to Registered.
      
      An Unregistered person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or
      prevented by the rules) register by publishing a message that
      indicates reasonably clearly and reasonably unambiguously eir
      desire to become a player at that time (for example, by saying "I
      register"). No person can be a player if e is part of another
      player or another player is part of em.
      
      A player, acting as emself, CAN deregister (cease being a player)
      by announcement. If e does so, e CANNOT register or be registered
      for 30 days.
      
      A person, by registering, agrees to abide by the Rules. The Rules
      CANNOT otherwise bind a person to abide by any agreement without
      that person's willful consent.
      
      The Rules CANNOT compel non-players to act without their express
      or reasonably implied consent. The rules CANNOT compel players to
      unduly harass non-players. A non-person CANNOT be a player, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 478/42 (Power=3)
Fora

      Publicity is a secured forum switch with values Public,
      Discussion, and Foreign (default), tracked by the Registrar.
      
      The Registrar CAN change the publicity of a forum without
      objection as long as:
      
      1. e sends eir announcement of intent to that forum; and
      
      2. if the forum is to be made public, the announcement by which
         the Registrar makes that forum public is sent to all existing
         public fora.
      
      Each player should ensure e can receive messages via each public
      forum.
      
      A public message is a message sent via a public forum, or sent to
      all players and containing a clear designation of intent to be
      public. A rule can also designate that a part of one public
      message is considered a public message in its own right. To
      "publish" or "announce" something is to send a public message
      whose body contains that thing. To do something "publicly" is
      to do that thing within a public message.
      
      Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
      announcement", that person performs that action by, in a single
      public message, specifying the action and setting forth intent to
      perform that action by sending that message, doing both clearly
      and unambiguously.
      
      Any action performed by sending a message is performed at the time
      date-stamped on that message. Actions in messages (including
      sub-messages) are performed in the order they appear in the
      message, unless otherwise specified. Allowing actions performed by
      sending a message to take place simultaneously must be done
      explicitly and is secured at power 2.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2139/17 (Power=2)
The Registrar

      The Registrar is an office; its holder is responsible for keeping
      track of players.
      
      The Registrar's weekly report includes:
      
      1. A list of all players, including information sufficient to
         identify and contact each player.
      
      2. The date on which each player most recently became a player.
      
      3. For each forum with non-Foreign publicity, sufficient
         instructions for players to receive messages there.
      
      The Registrar's monthly report includes:
      
      1. For each former player for which the information is reasonably
         available, the dates on which e registered and deregistered.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1789/11 (Power=3)
Cantus Cygneus

      Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously by
      the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part of
      it, e may submit a document to the Registrar, clearly labeled a
      Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and expressing eir
      reproach for those who e feels have treated em so badly.
      
      In a timely fashion after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the
      Registrar shall publish this document along with a Writ of
      Fugiendae Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione, commanding the Player
      to be deregistered. The Registrar shall note the method of
      deregistration for that Player in subsequent Registrar monthly
      Reports.
      
      The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and the
      notation in the Registrar's monthly report will ensure that,
      henceforth, all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of
      FAGE.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2646/2 (Power=3)
Activity

      Activity is a secured player switch tracked by the Registrar, with
      values Active (default) and Inactive.  To flip a player's activity
      to active (inactive) is to activate (deactivate) em.  The date on
      which each player's activity was last changed is part of the
      Registrar's weekly report.
      
      A player CAN, acting as emself, activate or deactivate emself by
      announcement.
      
      Any player CAN, with notice, make a player who has not made a
      public announcement in the past 30 days inactive.
      
      If a player has been inactive continuously for the past 60 days,
      then any player CAN deregister em without 3 objections. The
      Registrar SHOULD attempt to deregister players who meet this
      condition. The publication of intent for such a deregistration
      SHOULD be sent to the inactive player's registered email address
      at the same time that it is published.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2678/0 (Power=3)
Expectations of Participation

      An "Agoran forum" is a forum with publicity of discussion or
      public. Players of Agora have the following expectations of agoran
      fora:
      
      * Agoran fora allow equal participation for all players, subject
        to the rules of Agora and the explicitly stated rules of the
        fora.
      
      * The rules of participation in public fora are as closely aligned
        with the rules of Agora itself as possible; a player expects to
        be able to fully participate in all public fora as long as eir
        participation is in line with Agora's rules.
      
      * Agoran fora allow all interested persons, even those that are
        otherwise restricted in eir participation, to read all messages.
      
      * Discussion fora moderators may restrict participation subject to
        eir own clearly stated rules but should only do so to players
        temporarily and proportional to the harm of the rule breakage.
      
      * The content of discussion fora should primarily be about Agora
        itself, or reasonably adjacent topics.
      
      If an existing Agoran forum is in violation of these expectations,
      the Agoran community, led by the Registrar, SHOULD remove it or
      replace it with an appropriate forum as soon as possible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2679/1 (Power=3)
Restrictions on Participation

      Banned is a secured negative boolean person switch tracked by the
      Registrar. A person is unwelcome if e is Banned or if at least one
      part of em is unwelcome. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, an
      unwelcome person CANNOT register or be registered, and e is
      immediately deregistered if e is ever a player. Designations of
      unwelcomeness are secured.
      
      A Banned switch SHOULD ONLY be flipped by a proposal for the
      express purpose of flipping Banned switches.
      
      Flipping a Banned switch to True (banning a player) SHOULD ONLY be
      done when:
      
      * the person's actions have been deemed harmful to Agora, to any
        player of Agora, or the overall community, and
      
      * the harm has been clearly communicated to the person, and e has
        been given time to consider and respond, and
      
      * e has made no attempt to make amends, eir attempt was
        unsatisfactory, or e has continued to act in harmful ways.
      
      Actions that are harmful are subject to the discretion of the
      community of Agora, but may include: any form of identity-based
      discrimination, personal attacks, disrespect of values or beliefs
      of any member of the Agoran community, or provocative/bad-faith
      comments.
      
      Once a quarter, any unwelcome person may submit a Request for
      Forgiveness to the Registrar. Such a document SHOULD contain
      sincere self-reflection including any appropriate apologies and an
      indication on how e intends to avoid or prevent similar incidents
      in the future.
      
      The Registrar SHALL publish any Request for Forgiveness e receives
      in a timely manner. If the community deems the Request sincere and
      appropriately reconciliatory, steps should be undertaken to flip
      the submitter's Banned switch to False.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
General Definitions
   This section describes the terminology used by all the other rules.
   If, when reading a rule, you don't understand what a word means,
   chances are that the Agoran definition of that word is described in
   one of these rules.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2152/11 (Power=3)
Mother, May I?

      The following terms are defined. These definitions are used when a
      rule includes a term in all caps, and provide guidance in
      determining the ordinary-language meaning of a term when a rule
      includes a term otherwise. Earlier definitions take precedence
      over later ones. If a rule specifies one or more persons in
      connection with a term, then the term applies only to the
      specified person(s).
      
      1. CANNOT, IMPOSSIBLE, INEFFECTIVE, INVALID: Attempts to perform
         the described action are unsuccessful.
      
      2. MUST NOT, MAY NOT, SHALL NOT, ILLEGAL, PROHIBITED: Performing
         the described action violates the rule in question.
      
      3. NEED NOT, OPTIONAL: Failing to perform the described action
         does not violate the rules.
      
      4. SHOULD NOT, DISCOURAGED, DEPRECATED: Before performing the
         described action, the full implications of performing it ought
         to be be understood and carefully weighed.
      
      5. CAN, POSSIBLE, EFFECTIVE, VALID: Attempts to perform the
         described action are successful.
      
      6. MAY, LEGAL, PERMISSIBLE: Performing the described action does
         not violate the rules.
      
      7. MUST, SHALL, REQUIRED, MANDATORY: Failing to perform the
         described action violates the rule in question.
      
      8. SHOULD, ENCOURAGED, RECOMMENDED: Before failing to perform the
         described action, the full implications of failing to perform
         it ought to be understood and carefully weighed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2509/2 (Power=2)
Agoran Numbers

      A "number" is considered to refer to a real number, unless
      otherwise explicitly specified.  A "number of (items)", where
      (items) is a set of discrete entities, is considered to refer to a
      non-negative integer, unless otherwise explicitly specified.
      
      If a switch is defined as being associated with a specified set of
      numbers (a numerical switch), then the possible values for that
      switch are the numbers in that set. In particular, a natural or
      integer switch is a switch with possible values the non-negative
      integers or all integers, respectively. If a limit is further
      defined, the possible values are the numbers of the set within the
      specified limits.
      
      If 0 is in the specified values for a numerical switch and no
      default value is otherwise specified, 0 is the default value for
      that switch.
      
      If the rules describe mathematical operations to be used in
      flipping an instance of a numerical switch, the operations are
      interpreted as having common-sense mathematical application to
      determine that instance's resulting value. For example,
      "increasing a switch instance by M" is equivalent to "flipping a
      switch instance from its current value N to the value N+M". If the
      specified mathematical operation would result in a value outside
      that switch's defined set, the flipping CANNOT be performed, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2125/15 (Power=3)
Regulated Actions

      An action is regulated if: (1) the Rules limit, allow, enable, or
      permit its performance; (2) the Rules describe the circumstances
      under which the action would succeed or fail; or (3) the action
      would, as part of its effect, modify information for which some
      player is required to be a recordkeepor.
      
      A Regulated Action CAN only be performed as described by the
      Rules, and only using the methods explicitly specified in the
      Rules for performing the given action. The Rules are not to be
      interpreted so as to proscribe unregulated actions.
      
      The above notwithstanding, sending a message (in general or with
      specific attributes) is never a regulated action; however, the
      rules may be interpreted so as to proscribe sending public
      messages (in general or with specific attributes).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1023/40 (Power=2)
Agoran Time

      The following terms are defined:
      
      1. The phrase "in a timely fashion" means "within 7 days". This
         time period is set when the requirement is created (i.e. X days
         before the limit ends). A requirement to perform an action at
         an exact instant (e.g. "when X, Y SHALL Z"), but not "in the
         same message", is instead interpreted as a requirement to
         perform that action in a timely fashion after that instant.
      
      2. The phrase "in an officially timely fashion" means "before the
         end of the next Agoran week". This time period is set when the
         requirement is created (i.e. between 7 and 14 days before the
         period ends).
      
      3. Agoran epochs:
      
           1. Agoran days begin at midnight UTC.
      
           2. Agoran weeks begin at midnight UTC on Monday. Eastman
              weeks begin at midnight UTC on the 1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd,
              and 29th of each Gregorian month; the fifth one of the
              month (if any) lasts till the end of the month.
      
           3. Agoran months begin at midnight UTC on the first day of
              each Gregorian month.
      
           4. Agoran quarters begin when the Agoran months of January,
              April, July, and October begin.
      
           5. Agoran years begin when the Agoran month of January
              begins.
      
           6. A pivot is either the instant at which Agora Nomic began
              (June 30, 1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200) or an instant at which
              at least one person won the game. When used as a period of
              time, a "Round" (historical syn: "game") is the period of
              time between a pivot and the next pivot.
      
         The "Agoran" qualifier is assumed unless a different definition
         is indicated (e.g. Eastman weeks). These definitions do not
         apply to relative durations (e.g. "within <number> days after
         <event>").
      
      4. Two points in time are within a month of each other if:
      
          1. they occur in the same Agoran month;
      
          2. they occur in two consecutive Agoran months, and the later
             of the two occurs in an earlier day in the month than the
             earlier one;
      
          3. they occur in two consecutive Agoran months on the same day
             of the month, and the later of the two occurs at the same
             or earlier time of day.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1728/46 (Power=3)
Tabled Actions

      An action is a Tabled Action if the Rules purport to authorize its
      performance via one of the following methods:
      * With N Support, where N is a positive integer.
      * Without N Objections, where N is a positive integer.
      * With N Agoran Consent, where N is a positive integer multiple of
        0.1.
      * With T notice, where T is a time period.
      
      The parameters N and T, if omitted, default to 1 and 4 days,
      respectively (e.g. "without objection" means N=1). If a rule
      defines N as less than 1, it is instead treated as 1.
      
      A person, acting as emself, CAN by announcement table an intent
      (syn.  "intend") to perform a tabled action, clearly,
      conspicuously, explicitly, and without obfuscation specifying the
      action, the method (including non-default parameter values), and,
      optionally, conditions.
      
      A person is the sponsor of such an intent if e tabled it, or if e
      is authorized to perform its action due to holding a rule-defined
      position previously held by the person who tabled it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2124/32 (Power=3)
Performing Tabled Actions

      For a given tabled intent, a player CAN, unless otherwise
      forbidden by the rules or the document enabling the action, act on
      eir own behalf, by announcement, to:
      * Become a supporter ("support" it), unless e tabled or previously
        supported it;
      * Become an objector ("object to" it), unless e previously
        objected to it;
      
      A supporter/objector to an intent, acting as emself, CAN by
      announcement cease to be a supporter/objector ("withdraw"
      support/objection) of that intent.
      
      Limiting the ability to support or object to an intent is secured
      at the power of the rule enabling that action to be performed.
      
      An intent is ripe if was tabled within the past 14 days, the
      Speaker hasn't objected to it in the past 48 hours, and its
      conditions, if any, are each clearly and unambiguously met.
      
      An intent is mature if it was tabled at least 4 days ago and
      nobody withdrew objections from it in the past 24 hours.
      
      A rule purporting to allow a person to perform a tabled action
      allows em to do so by announcement, if, considering only intents
      for that action/method combination:
      * With N Support: e is a sponsor or supporter of a ripe intent with
        at least N supporters.
      * Without N Objections: e is a sponsor of a mature ripe intent with
        less than N objectors.
      * With N Agoran Consent: e is a sponsor or supporter of a mature
        ripe intent with supporters greater than N times its objectors
        (e SHOULD list supporters and objectors).
      * With T notice: e is the sponsor of a ripe intent created at
        least T ago.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2518/1 (Power=3)
Determinacy

      If a value CANNOT be reasonably determined (without circularity or
      paradox) from information reasonably available, or if it
      alternates indefinitely between values, then the value is
      considered to be indeterminate, otherwise it is determinate.
      
      A communication purporting to express conditional intent to
      perform an action is considered unclear and ambiguous unless, at a
      minimum, the conditional is determinate, true, and reasonably
      straightforward to evaluate with publicly-available information at
      the time of communication. The communicator SHOULD explain
      specific reasons for being uncertain of the outcome when e makes
      the communication.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2505/1 (Power=1)
Random Choices

      When a Rule specifies that a random choice be made, then the
      choice shall be made using whatever probability distribution among
      the possible outcomes the Rule specifies, defaulting to a uniform
      probability distribution.
      
      The choice can be made using any physical or computational process
      whose probability distribution among the possible outcomes is
      reasonably close to that required by the Rules, and for which the
      final choice is not trivially predictable by the selecting person
      in advance. The selecting person SHOULD make the selection method
      public, and SHOULD use a method for which the final probability
      distribution can be readily confirmed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2681/0 (Power=1)
Acting on Commitment

      A Fingerprint for a document (the Plaintext) is a document that
      could not have been reasonably created without knowledge of the
      Plaintext, and which is related to the Plaintext in such a way
      that one could not reasonably produce another document related to
      that Fingerprint in the same way.
      
      Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
      commitment" to a particular kind of document, that person performs
      that action by performing it by announcement while, in the same
      message, also publishing a what is purportedly a Fingerprint for a
      document of that kind.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Entities
   "Entity" is a confusing word to new players. This section describes
   what an entity is.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1586/9 (Power=2)
Definition and Continuity of Entities

      If multiple rules attempt to define an entity with the same name,
      then they refer to the same entity. A rule-defined entity's name
      CANNOT be changed to be the same as another rule-defined entity's
      name.
      
      A rule, contract, or regulation that refers to an entity by name
      refers to the entity that had that name when the rule first came
      to include that reference, even if the entity's name has since
      changed.
      
      If the entity that defines another entity is amended such that it
      no longer defines the second entity, then the second entity and
      its attributes cease to exist.
      
      If the entity that defines another entity is amended such that it
      defines the second entity both before and after the amendment, but
      with different attributes, then the second entity and its
      attributes continue to exist to whatever extent is possible under
      the new definitions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2162/14 (Power=3)
Switches

      A type of switch is a property that the rules define as a switch,
      and specify the following:
      
      1. The type(s) of entity possessing an instance of that switch. No
         other entity possesses an instance of that switch.
      
      2. One or more possible values for instances of that switch,
         exactly one of which should be designated as the default. No
         values other than those listed are possible for instances of
         that switch, except that, if no default is otherwise
         specified, then rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the
         "null" value is a possible value for that switch, and is the
         default.
      
      3. Optionally, exactly one office whose holder tracks instances of
         that switch. That officer's (weekly, if not specified
         otherwise) report includes the value of each instance of that
         switch whose value is not its default value; a public document
         purporting to be this portion of that officer's report is
         self-ratifying, and implies that other instances are at their
         default value.
      
      At any given time, each instance of a switch has exactly one
      possible value for that type of switch. If an instance of a switch
      comes to have a value, it ceases to have any other value. If an
      instance of a switch would otherwise fail to have a possible
      value, it comes to have its default value. A Rule that designates
      a switch as "secured" (at a given power level) designates changes
      to the properties of that type of switch as secured (at that power
      level) and designates changes to the value of each instance of the
      switch as secured (at that power level).
      
      "To flip an instance of a switch" is to make it come to have a
      given value. "To become X" (where X is a possible value of
      exactly one of the subject's switches) is to flip that switch to
      X.
      
      If a type of switch is not explicitly designated as
      possibly-indeterminate by the rule that defines it, and if an
      action or set of actions would cause the value of an instance of
      that type of switch to become indeterminate, that instance instead
      takes on its last determinate and possible value, if any,
      otherwise it takes on its default value.
      
      A singleton switch is a switch for which Agora Nomic is the only
      entity possessing an instance of that switch.
      
      A boolean switch is a switch with values True and False. A
      positive boolean switch has a default of True; a negative boolean
      switch has a default of False.
      
      Attempting to flip an instance of a switch to a value it already
      has does not flip the switch. However, if a person is REQUIRED to
      flip a switch instance to a value it already has, then either
      attempting to do so using the required mechanism, or announcing
      that the switch already has the required value, fulfills the
      requirement without flipping the switch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1688/11 (Power=3)
Power

      The Power of an entity is a non-negative rational number. An
      instrument is an entity with positive Power.
      
      The Power of an entity cannot be set or modified except as
      stipulated by the Rules. All entities have Power zero except where
      specifically allowed by the rules.
      
      A Rule that makes a change, action, or value secured (hereafter
      the securing Rule) thereby makes it IMPOSSIBLE to perform that
      change or action, or to set or modify that value, except as
      allowed by an instrument with Power greater than or equal to the
      change's Power Threshold. This Threshold defaults to the securing
      Rule's Power, but CAN be lowered as allowed by that Rule
      (including by the Rule itself).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2140/5 (Power=3)
Power Controls Mutability

      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no entity with power below
      the power of this rule can
      
      1. cause an entity to have power greater than its own.
      
      2. adjust the power of an instrument with power greater than its
      own.
      
      3. set or modify any other substantive aspect of an instrument
      with power greater than its own (that is, one that affects the
      instrument's operation).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Proposals
   Proposals are a staple of Nomic games. If you're a new player, this
   is another important section, since the way proposals work in this
   Nomic is a little bit complicated.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2350/19 (Power=3)
Proposals

      A proposal is a type of entity consisting of a body of text and
      other attributes. A player CAN create (syn. submit) a proposal by
      announcement, specifying its text and optionally specifying any of
      the following attributes:
      
      * An associated title.
      
      * A list of coauthors (which must be persons other than the
        author).
      
      * An adoption index.
      
      Creating a proposal adds it to the Proposal Pool. Once a proposal
      is created, its text, author, and AI cannot be changed. The author
      (syn. proposer) of a proposal is the person who created it.
      
      The author of a proposal in the Proposal Pool CAN remove (syn.
      retract, withdraw) it from the Pool by announcement.
      
      The destruction of a proposal and the causing of a proposal to
      cease being a proposal are secured. The removal of a proposal from
      the Proposal Pool, other than by distribution, is secured.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2625/1 (Power=1.0)
Proposal Recycling

      If a referendum on a proposal was resolved as FAILED QUORUM in the
      last seven days, the Promotor CAN once recycle the proposal by
      announcement, adding it to the Proposal Pool and causing it to
      become pended.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2606/3 (Power=2.0)
Proposal Classes

      Proposals created since the enactment of this rule have a secured
      untracked Class switch with possible values ordinary (the default)
      and democratic.
      
      When a proposal with an adoption index greater than or equal to
      3.0 is created, its class becomes democratic.
      
      Any player CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, flip an ordinary proposal's
      class to democratic, provided that it is in the Proposal Pool or
      that there is an referendum on it whose voting period has not yet
      ended.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1607/56 (Power=3)
Distribution

      The Promotor is an office; its holder is responsible for receiving
      and distributing proposals.
      
      A referendum is the Agoran decision to determine whether to adopt
      a proposal.  For this decision, the vote collector is the
      Assessor, the adoption index is initially the adoption index of
      the proposal, or 1.0 if the proposal does not have one, and the
      text, author, coauthors, and class of the proposal are essential
      parameters. Initiating a referendum is known as distribution, and
      removes the proposal from the Proposal Pool.
      
      The Promotor CAN distribute a proposal which is in the Proposal
      Pool at any time.
      
      In a given Agoran week, the Promotor SHALL distribute each
      proposal that was in the Proposal Pool at the beginning of that
      week, except for those excepted from automatic distribution by
      other rules, or those that are otherwise removed from the Pool. If
      there are ten or more undistributed proposals in the proposal
      pool, the promotor MAY refrain from distributing the most recently
      added 5 proposals if e distributes each other proposal in that
      Agoran week.
      
      Distributed proposals have ID numbers, to be assigned by the
      Promotor.
      
      If there is a Proposal in the Pool that it would otherwise be
      IMPOSSIBLE for any player to distribute, then any player CAN
      distribute that Proposal without 3 objections.
      
      The Promotor's report includes a list of all proposals in the
      Proposal Pool, along with their text and attributes. This portion
      of a public document purporting to be a Promotor's report is
      self-ratifying.
      
      The destruction of a referendum is secured. Causing a referendum
      to cease being a referendum is secured.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2137/2 (Power=1)
The Assessor

      The Assessor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      collecting votes and keeping track of related properties.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 106/45 (Power=3)
Adopting Proposals

      When a referendum on a proposal is resolved, if the outcome is
      ADOPTED, then the proposal in question is adopted, its power is
      set to the minimum of four and its adoption index, and it takes
      effect. Proposals CANNOT otherwise be adopted or take effect,
      rules to the contrary notwithstanding.
      
      When a proposal takes effect, the proposal applies the changes
      that it specifies in its text, except as prohibited by other
      rules. Unless otherwise specified by the text, the effects are
      applied in the order they appear in the text. Clearly marked
      comments are ignored. If the proposal cannot make some changes it
      specifies, that does not preclude the other changes from taking
      place.
      
      Except insofar as the actions performed by a proposal happen one
      after another, rather than simultaneously, a proposal's effect is
      instantaneous. A proposal can neither delay nor extend its own
      effect.  Once a proposal finishes taking effect, its power is set
      to 0.
      
      No entity with power below the power of this rule can prevent a
      proposal from taking effect; this does not apply to generally
      preventing changes to specified areas of the gamestate, nor to a
      proposal preventing itself from taking effect (its no-effect
      clause is generally interpreted as applying only to the rest of
      the proposal).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Rules & Regulations
   Ah, yes. What would any game be without rules? And these rules
   describe how rules work. This section also describes the governance
   of the Rulekeepor.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2141/16 (Power=3.2)
Role and Attributes of Rules

      A rule is a type of instrument that is always taking effect and
      has the capacity to govern the game generally. A rule's content
      takes the form of a text, and is unlimited in scope. The ruleset
      is the set of all currently-existing rules.
      
      Every current rule has power between 0.1 and 4.0 inclusive.
      
      Every rule shall have an ID number, distinct among current and
      former rules, to be assigned once by the Rulekeepor by public
      designation.
      
      Every rule shall have a title to aid in identification. If a rule
      ever does not have a title, then the Rulekeepor CAN and SHALL
      assign a title to it by announcement in a timely fashion.
      
      For the purposes of rules governing modification of instruments,
      the text, power, ID number, and title of a rule are all
      substantive aspects of the rule. However, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the Rulekeepor CAN set rule aspects as described
      elsewhere in this rule.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 217/12 (Power=3)
Interpreting the Rules

      When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
      takes precedence. Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
      unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense, past
      judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the game.
      
      Definitions and prescriptions in the rules are only to be applied
      using direct, forward reasoning; in particular, an absurdity that
      can be concluded from the assumption that a statement about
      rule-defined concepts is false does not constitute proof that it
      is true. Definitions in lower-powered Rules do not overrule
      common-sense interpretations or common definitions of terms in
      higher-powered rules, but may constructively make reasonable
      clarifications to those definitions. For this purpose, a
      clarification is reasonable if and only if it adds detail without
      changing the underlying general meaning of the term and without
      causing the higher powered rule to be read in a way inconsistent
      with its text.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any rule change that would
      (1) prevent a person from initiating a formal process to resolve
      matters of controversy, in the reasonable expectation that the
      controversy will thereby be resolved; or (2) prevent a person from
      causing formal reconsideration of any judicial determination that
      e should be punished, is wholly void and without effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1030/13 (Power=3.3)
Precedence between Rules

      In a conflict between Rules, the conflict shall be resolved by
      performing the following comparisons in the sequence written in
      this rule, until the conflict is resolved.
      
      - In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
        the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
        Power; otherwise,
      
      - If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
        precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
        determining precedence relations, then the determinations of the
        precedence-determining Rule shall be used to resolve the
        conflicts; otherwise,
      
      - If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
        itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or takes
        precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
        provisions shall be used to resolve the conflict, unless they
        lead to contradictions between each other; otherwise,
      
      - If any of the rules in conflict have ID numbers, then the Rule
        with the lowest ID number takes precedence; otherwise,
      
      - The Rule enacted earliest takes precedence.
      
      Clauses in any other rule that broadly claim precedence (e.g. over
      "all rules" of a certain class) shall be, prima facie, considered
      to be limited claims of precedence or deference that are
      applicable only when such claims are evaluated as described within
      the above sequence.
      
      No change to the ruleset can occur that would cause a Rule to
      directly claim precedence over this Rule as a means of determining
      precedence. This applies to changes by the enactment or amendment
      of a Rule, or of any other form. This Rule takes precedence over
      any Rule that would permit such a change to the ruleset.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2240/1 (Power=3)
No Cretans Need Apply

      In a conflict between clauses of the same Rule, if exactly one
      claims precedence over the other, then it takes precedence;
      otherwise, the later clause takes precedence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 105/23 (Power=3)
Rule Changes

      When the rules provide that an instrument takes effect, it can
      generally:
      
      1. enact a rule. The new rule has power equal to the minimum of
         the power specified by the enacting instrument, defaulting to
         one if the enacting instrument does not specify or if it
         specifies a power less than 0.1, and the maximum power
         permitted by other rules. The enacting instrument may specify a
         title for the new rule, which if present shall prevail. The ID
         number of the new rule cannot be specified by the enacting
         instrument; any attempt to so specify is null and void.
      
      2. repeal a rule. When a rule is repealed, it ceases to be a rule,
         its power is set to 0, and the Rulekeepor need no longer
         maintain a record of it.
      
      3. reenact a rule. A repealed rule identified by its most recent
         rule number MUST be reenacted with the same ID number and the
         next change identifier. If no text is specified, the rule is
         reenacted with the same text it had when it was most recently
         repealed. If the reenacting proposal provides new text for the
         rule, the rule SHOULD have materially the same purpose as did
         the repealed version. Unless specified otherwise by the
         reenacting instrument, a reenacted rule has power equal to the
         power it had at the time of its repeal (or power 1, if power
         was not defined at the time of that rule's repeal). If the
         reenacting instrument is incapable of setting the reenacted
         rule's power to that value, then the reenactment is null and
         void.
      
      4. amend the text of a rule.
      
      5. retitle (syn. amend the title of) a rule.
      
      6. change the power of a rule.
      
      A rule change is any effect that falls into the above classes.
      Rule changes always occur sequentially, never simultaneously.
      
      Any ambiguity in the specification of a rule change causes that
      change to be void and without effect. An inconsequential variation
      in the quotation of an existing rule does not constitute ambiguity
      for the purposes of this rule, but any other variation does.
      
      A rule change is wholly prevented from taking effect unless its
      full text was published, along with an unambiguous and clear
      specification of the method to be used for changing the rule, at
      least 4 days and no more than 60 days before it would otherwise
      take effect.
      
      This rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be
      created, modified, or destroyed, or by which an entity can become
      a rule or cease to be a rule.

Rule 2493/10 (Power=3)
Regulations

      A regulation is a textual entity defined as such by this rule, and
      under the authority of a person, known as its Promulgator. A
      regulation must be authorized by a rule (its parent rule) in order
      to exist. It has only the effect that rule explicitly gives it.
      
      A regulation CAN be enacted, amended, and repealed as specified by
      its parent rule. By default, a person CAN, with 2 Agoran consent,
      enact, amend, or repeal a regulation for which e is the
      Promulgator. Regulations are tracked by the Rulekeepor as part of
      eir monthly report in a fashion similar to rules.

Rule 1051/17 (Power=1)
The Rulekeepor

      The Rulekeepor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      maintaining the text of the rules of Agora.
      
      The Rulekeepor's Weekly report includes the Short Logical Ruleset.
      The Rulekeepor's Monthly report includes the Full Logical Ruleset.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1681/23 (Power=1)
The Logical Rulesets

      The Short Logical Ruleset (SLR) is a format of the ruleset. In
      this format, each rule is assigned to a category, and the rules
      are grouped according to their category.
      
      Rules are assigned to, ordered within, or moved between
      categories, and categories are added, changed, or empty categories
      removed, as the Rulekeepor sees fit.
      
      The listing of each rule in the SLR must include the rule's ID
      number, revision number, power, title, and text.
      
      The Rulekeepor is strongly DISCOURAGED from including any
      additional information in the SLR, except that which increases the
      readability of the SLR.
      
      The Full Logical Ruleset (FLR) is a format of the ruleset. In this
      format, rules are assigned to the same category and presented in
      the same order as in the SLR. The FLR must contain all the
      information required to be in the SLR, and any historical
      annotations which the Rulekeepor is required to record.
      
      The Rulekeepor SHOULD also include any other information which e
      feels may be helpful in the use of the ruleset in the FLR.
      
      Whenever a rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeepor SHALL record
      and thereafter maintain a reasonably accurate historical
      annotation to the rule indicating:
      
      1. The type of change.
      
      2. The date on which the change took effect.
      
      3. The mechanism that specified the change.
      
      4. If the rule was changed due to a proposal, then that proposal's
         ID number, author, and coauthor(s) (if any).

Rule 2221/9 (Power=3)
Cleanliness and Tidy Filing

      Any player CAN clean a rule without objection by specifying one or
      more corrections to spelling, grammar, capitalization, formatting,
      and/or dialect, or to whether a synonym or abbreviation is used in
      place of a word or phrase, in the rule's text and/or title; the
      rule is amended by this rule as specified by that person.
      
      Any player CAN refile a rule without objection, specifying a new
      title; the rule is retitled to the specified title by this rule.
      
      Cleaning rules is secured. Refiling rules is secured.

Rule 2429/2 (Power=1)
Bleach

      Replacing a non-zero amount of whitespace with a different
      non-zero amount of whitespace is generally insignificant, except
      if doing so substantially changes the semantic, logical, or
      artistic structure of the text.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2614/9 (Power=3.1)
Eclipse Light

      An emergency message is one whose subject line contains the text
      "[Emergency]".
      
      The Prime Minister CAN, in an emergency message and with 3 Agoran
      consent, enact, amend, or repeal Emergency Regulations, provided
      that the intent to do so was also contained in an emergency
      message. To the extent explicitly permitted by this rule,
      Emergency regulations are always taking effect.
      
      Emergency Regulations CAN, as part of their effect:
        - Extend any deadline provided for by any instrument other than
          this rule, including a deadline for an obligation to be met,
          or deadline prior to which an action must be performed in
          order to be valid, such as the end of voting period. Such an
          extension CANNOT cause the total time period, such as the
          time from when an obligation was created to the deadline or
          the whole of a voting period, to be more than double its
          original length.
        - Create, destroy, or transfer assets, or require or forbid
          their creation, destruction, or transfer.
        - Collectively, exercise Mint Authority
        - Cause one or more players to win Agora.
        - Appoint or remove officeholders, other than Prime Minister or
          Speaker.
        - Modify the Festivity.
        - Award Patent Titles that are either Badges or are not
          mentioned in any Rule.
        - Modify the Publicity of Fora.
      
      The Prime Minister CAN, in an emergency message and with 4 Agoran
      Consent, provided that the intent to do so was also contained in
      an emergency message, Extend the Emergency.
      
      If there is an Emergency Regulation that has existed for at least
      a month and the Prime Minister has not Extended the Emergency in
      the past month, any player CAN, with 7 days notice, cause this
      rule to repeal all Emergency Regulations.
      
      If the Prime Minister has not sent a message to a public forum in
      the preceding four days, the Speaker CAN exercise eir powers under
      this rule as if e were the Prime Minister, and notwithstanding any
      rule that would prohibit a single player from holding both
      offices.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, Emergency Regulations
      CANNOT be enacted, amended, or repealed except as described in
      this Rule.

Voting
   Voting is used primarily for Proposals and Elections. This section
   describes Agoran Decisions and how to resolve them.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 693/17 (Power=3)
Agoran Decisions

      When the rules call for an Agoran decision to be made, the
      decision-making process takes place in the following three
      stages, each described elsewhere:
      
      1. Initiation of the decision.
      
      2. Voting of the people.
      
      3. Resolution of the decision.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 107/26 (Power=3)
Initiating Agoran Decisions

      An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
      initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
      to initiate the decision. To be valid, the notice must clearly
      specify the following information:
      
      1. The matter to be decided (for example, "the adoption of
         proposal 4781");
      
      2. The voting method;
      
      3. A clear description of the valid options;
      
      4. The identity of the vote collector; and
      
      5. Any additional information defined by the rules as essential
         parameters.
      
      The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting period
      for the decision. The default length of the voting period is 7
      days. Changing the length of a decision's voting period is secured
      at power 2, and it CANNOT be set or changed to more than 14 days,
      or less than 5 days for a decision with at least two options.
      
      The vote collector for a decision with less than two options CAN
      end the voting period by announcement, if it has not ended
      already, and provided that e resolves the decision in the same
      message.
      
      A public notice purporting to initiate an Agoran decision is a
      self-ratifying attestation that the notice was valid, that the
      person (if any) publishing the notice was authorized to initiate
      the decision, and that such a decision was initiated.
      
      The destruction of an Agoran decision and the causing of an Agoran
      decision to cease being an Agoran decision are secured at the
      power of the Rule authorizing the initiation of such a decision.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2528/0 (Power=3)
Voting Methods

      Each Agoran decision has a voting method, which must be
      AI-majority, instant runoff, or first-past-the-post. The voting
      method is that specified by the authorizing authority, or
      first-past-the-post by default.
      
      Each Agoran decision has a set of valid options (the choices that
      the voters are being asked to select from) and valid votes (the
      ways in which the voters can express their opinion or lack
      thereof. For AI-majority decisions, the valid options are FOR and
      AGAINST; for other decisions, the valid options are defined by
      other rules.
      
      The valid votes on an Agoran decision are:
      
      1. PRESENT;
      
      2. The valid conditional votes, as defined by rules of power at
         least that of this rule; and
      
      3. For an instant runoff decision, the ordered lists of entities.
      
      4. For any other decision, the valid options.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 683/27 (Power=3)
Voting on Agoran Decisions

      An entity submits a ballot on an Agoran decision by publishing a
      notice satisfying the following conditions:
      
      1. The ballot is submitted during the voting period for the
         decision.
      
      2. The entity casting the ballot (the voter) was, at the
         initiation of the decision, a player.
      
      3. The ballot clearly identifies the matter to be decided.
      
      4. The ballot clearly identifies a valid vote, as determined by
         the voting method.
      
      5. The ballot clearly sets forth the voter's intent to place
         the identified vote.
      
      6. The voter has no other valid ballots on the same decision.
      
      A valid ballot is a ballot, correctly submitted, that has not been
      withdrawn. During the voting period of an Agoran decision, an
      entity CAN by announcement withdraw (syn. retract) a ballot that e
      submitted on that decision. To "change" one's vote is to retract
      eir previous ballot (if any), then submit a new one. Submitting
      and withdrawing ballots is secured.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 208/14 (Power=3)
Resolving Agoran Decisions

      The vote collector for an unresolved Agoran decision CAN resolve
      it by announcement, indicating the outcome. If it was required to
      be initiated, then e SHALL resolve it in a timely fashion after
      the end of the voting period. To be EFFECTIVE, such an attempt
      must satisfy the following conditions:
      
      1. It is published after the voting period has ended.
      
      2. It clearly identifies the matter to be resolved.
      
      3. It specifies the number of voters (or a list of the voters).
         For these purposes and for determining quorum, a "voter" is
         someone who submitted a ballot on the decision that was valid
         when it was submitted and also valid (i.e. not withdrawn or
         otherwise invalidated) at the end of the voting period.
      
      4. It specifies the outcome, as described elsewhere, and, if there
         was more than one valid option, provides a tally of the voters'
         valid ballots.
      
      Each Agoran decision has exactly one vote collector, defaulting to
      the initiator of the decision. If the vote collector is defined by
      reference to a position (or, in the default case, if the initiator
      was so defined), then the vote collector is the current holder of
      that position.
      
      This rule takes precedence over any rule that would provide
      another mechanism by which an Agoran decision may be resolved.
      
      In general, changes to the gamestate due to the outcome of an
      Agoran decision take effect when the decision is resolved.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 955/27 (Power=3)
Determining the Will of Agora

      Each Agoran decision has a voting method, which determines how
      voters may vote on it and how to calculate the outcome. The
      strength of a ballot is the voting strength of the voter who cast
      it on that Agoran decision, as calculated at the end of that
      decision's voting period.
      
      1. For an AI-majority decision, let F be the total strength of all
         valid ballots cast FOR a decision, A be the same for AGAINST,
         and AI be the adoption index of the decision. The outcome is
         ADOPTED if F/A >= AI and F/A > 1 (or F>0 and A=0), otherwise
         REJECTED.
      
      2. For an instant runoff decision, the outcome is whichever option
         wins according to the standard definition of instant runoff.
         For this purpose, a ballot of strength N is treated as if it
         were N distinct ballots expressing the same preferences. In
         case multiple valid options tie for the lowest number of votes
         at any stage, the vote collector CAN and must, in the
         announcement of the decision's resolution, select one such
         option to eliminate; if, for M > 1, all eir possible choices in
         the next M stages would result in the same set of options being
         eliminated, e need not specify the order of elimination. If an
         entity that is part of a valid vote is not a valid option at
         the end of the voting period, or disqualified by the rule
         providing for the decision, then that entity is eliminated
         prior to the first round of counting.
      
      3. For a first-past-the-post decision, the outcome is whichever
         option received the highest total strength of valid ballots. In
         case of a tie, the vote collector CAN and must, in the
         announcement of the decision's resolution, select one of the
         leaders as the outcome.
      
      The previous notwithstanding:
      
      - If there is more than one option, and the number of voters is
        less than the quorum of that decision, the outcome is instead
        FAILED QUORUM.
      
      - If there are no valid options, the outcome is null.
      
      The outcome of a decision is determined when it is resolved, and
      cannot change thereafter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 879/40 (Power=3)
Quorum

      Each Agoran decision has a quorum. This is a number set when the
      decision is created, and thereafter cannot be changed. When a
      person initiates an Agoran decision, that person SHALL state the
      quorum of that decision. However, incorrectly stating the quorum
      of a decision does not invalidate the initiation, nor does it
      actually change the quorum of the decision.
      
      The quorum that an Agoran decision gains as it is created can be
      defined by other rules of power 2 or greater. If no other rule
      defines the quorum of an Agoran decision, the quorum for that
      decision is equal to 2/3 of the number of voters on the referendum
      that had been most recently resolved at the time of that
      decision's initiation, the whole rounded to the nearest integer.
      
      As an exception to the previous paragraph, the minimum quorum of
      an Agoran decision is 2, or 1 if there are fewer than 2 players in
      the game. If the rules would attempt to set the quorum of an
      Agoran decision to less than the minimum quorum, it is set to the
      minimum instead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2422/8 (Power=3)
Voting Strength

      The voting strength of an entity on an Agoran decision is an
      integer between 0 and 15 inclusive, defined by rules of power 2 or
      greater. If not otherwise specified, the voting strength of an
      entity on an Agoran decision is 3.
      
      When multiple rules set or modify an entity's voting strength on
      an Agoran decision, it shall be determined by first applying the
      rule(s) which set it to a specific value, using the ordinary
      precedence of rules, and then applying the rules, other than this
      one, which modify it, in numerical order by ID. Finally, if the
      result of the calculation is not an integer, it is rounded up, and
      then if it is outside the allowable range of values for voting
      strength, it is set to the minimum value if it was less and the
      maximum value if it was more.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2127/11 (Power=3)
Conditional Votes

      A conditional vote on an Agoran decision is a vote which indicates
      a vote based on some condition(s). A conditional vote is evaluated
      at the end of the voting period and, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, is clearly specified if and only if the value of
      the condition(s) is/are determinate at the end of the voting
      period. If the conditional is clearly specified, and evaluates to
      a valid vote, it is counted as that vote; otherwise, it is counted
      as PRESENT.
      
      Any vote which is clearly expressed as a conditional, e.g. "FOR if
      <X> is true, AGAINST otherwise", is a valid conditional vote that
      evaluates as specified.
      
      A vote endorsing another person is equivalent to a conditional
      vote evaluating to the vote specified in that person's valid
      ballot on the decision, if any.
      
      For an instant runoff decision, a vote consisting of a list, one
      or more entries of which are valid conditional votes, and the
      remaining entries of which are valid options, is a valid
      conditional vote. Such a vote is evaluated by evaluating each
      conditional entry to a list of votes (or an empty list, if it
      evaluates to PRESENT either directly or indirectly), and then
      concatenating those lists with the specified valid options in the
      order they occurred in the original vote.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2168/9 (Power=2)
Extending the Voting Period

      Whenever the voting period of an Agoran decision would end, and
      the result would be FAILED QUORUM, the length of the voting period
      for that decision is instead increased to 14 days, except if it is
      already that length, provided this has not already happened for
      the decision in question.
      
      Within four days of such an occurrence, the vote collector for the
      decision SHALL issue a humiliating public reminder naming the
      slackers who have not yet cast any votes on it despite being
      eligible, and CAN end its voting period by announcement (resolving
      it constitutes an implicit announcement that its voting period is
      first ended) if the result would no longer be FAILED QUORUM, or if
      the decision is a referendum on a proposal and no voter (other
      than possibly the proposal's author) has voted FOR.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1950/37 (Power=3)
Decisions with Adoption Indices

      Adoption index (AI) is an untracked switch possessed by Agoran
      decisions and proposals, secured at power 2.  For decisions, the
      possible values are "none" (default) or integral multiples of 0.1
      from 1.0 to 9.9. For proposals, the possible values are integral
      multiples of 0.1 from 1.0 to 9.9 (default 1.0). If a referendum
      has an adoption index less than the adoption index of its
      associated proposal, the referendum's adoption index is
      immediately set to that of the associated proposal
      
      Adoption index is secured with a Power Threshold of 2.
      
      Adoption index is an essential parameter of an Agoran decision if
      that decision has an adoption index.
      
      For any Agoran decision with a non-"none" adoption index, the
      voting method is AI-majority.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2034/12 (Power=3)
Vote Protection and Cutoff for Challenges

      A public message purporting to resolve an Agoran decision is a
      self-ratifying attestation that
      
      1. such a decision existed,
      
      2. it had the number of voters indicated,
      
      3. it was resolved as indicated, and
      
      4. (if the indicated outcome was to adopt a proposal) such a
         proposal existed, was adopted, and, if it had not
         previously taken effect, took effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Offices & Reporting
   Players who hold offices have control over and track various
   different mechanics. These rules govern the special responsibilities
   that officers have.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1006/46 (Power=2)
Offices

      An Office is a position described as an Office by the Rules.
      Officeholder is an office switch tracked by the ADoP, with
      possible values of any person or "vacant" (default). An officer is
      the holder of an office, who may be referred to by the name of
      that office. If the holder of an office is ever not a player, it
      becomes vacant.
      
      An imposed office is an office described as such by the rule
      defining it. All others are elected. A person CANNOT be made the
      holder of an elected office without eir explicit or reasonably
      implied consent.
      
      The holder of an elected office CAN resign it by announcement,
      causing it to become vacant. The non-interim holder of an elected
      office CAN, with 3 support, resign the office while appointing
      another player to become the holder of the office, provided that
      other player is one of the Supporters. Any player CAN cause an
      office to become vacant without 2 objections.
      
      Immediately after a proposal finishes taking effect, if one or
      more offices exist that did not exist prior to the proposal taking
      effect, each such office, if it is vacant, becomes held by the
      author of the proposal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2630/2 (Power=2.0)
The Administrative State

      Each officer CAN, with 1.5 Agoran consent, enact, amend, or repeal
      eir own office's Administrative Regulations. If e has won an
      election for the office in the last 7 days, e CAN repeal them by
      announcement.  Administrative Regulations have the following
      properties:
      
      1. An officer SHALL NOT violate requirements in eir office's
         administrative regulations clearly intended to be punishable as
         rules violations in the discharge of eir office.
      2. Any player CAN act on behalf of an officer to exercise eir
         official powers as authorized by eir office's administrative
         regulations.
      3. All players SHOULD abide by an officer's administrative
         regulations in matters relating to eir area of responsibility.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2651/1 (Power=2)
The Election Cycle

      A holder of an elected office who did not become its holder by
      winning an election, and has not won an election for that office
      since, is an interim holder. An elected office that is either
      vacant or has an interim holder is an interim office.
      
      An office is term-limited if the most recent election for that
      office was resolved more than the length of that office's term
      prior. The term for the office of Prime Minister is 90 days. The
      term for all other elected offices is 180 days.
      
      A player CAN initiate an election for a specified elected office:
      
      
      a) With 2 support (if the office is either interim or term-
      limited) or 4 support (otherwise), and provided that the initiator
      becomes a candidate in the same message.
      
      b) By announcement, if e is the ADoP (or, if the office is the
      ADoP, if e is the Assessor) and the office is interim, or if e is
      the holder of that office.
      
      Once per quarter, the ADoP CAN and SHALL publish a Notice of
      Election specifying between 2-4 term-limited offices (if there
      fewer than 2 term-limited offices, the ADoP MUST instead list all
      of them).  Such a notice initiates elections for the specified
      offices.  The ADoP SHOULD prioritize offices that have gone
      longest since their last elections.
      
      The above notwithstanding, an election for an office CANNOT be
      initiated if one is already in progress.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2154/61 (Power=2)
Election Procedure

      When an election is initiated, it enters the nomination period,
      which lasts for 4 days. After an election is initiated and until
      nominations close, any player CAN become a candidate by
      announcement. A candidate ceases to be a candidate if e ceases to
      be a player during the election or if holding the office would
      make em Overpowered. During the nomination period, a candidate CAN
      cease to be a candidate by announcement if there is at least one
      other candidate.
      
      Each candidate in an election is ENCOURAGED to campaign by
      indicating why e would be the best choice, and (if applicable) how
      e would run the office differently than the previous holder.  The
      ADoP SHOULD remind candidates to campaign.
      
      An election whose nomination period is complete is contested if it
      has two or more candidates, and uncontested otherwise. Nominations
      close at the end of the poll's voting period or when the election
      is ended, whichever comes first.
      
      After the nomination period ends, the ADoP (or, if the office is
      the ADoP, the Assessor) CAN and, in a timely fashion, SHALL:
      
      1) If the election is contested, initiate an Agoran decision to
         select the winner of the election (the poll). For this
         decision, the Vote Collector is the ADoP (or, if the office is
         the ADoP, the Assessor), the valid options are the candidates
         for that election (including those who become candidates after
         its initiation), and the voting method is instant runoff. When
         the poll is resolved, its outcome, if a player, wins the
         election. If the outcome is not a player, the election ends
         with no winner.
      
      2) If POSSIBLE per the following paragraph, end the election
         immediately.
      
      If at any point an uncontested election has a single candidate,
      then any player CAN by announcement declare em the winner of the
      election, thereby causing em to win the election. If at any point
      an uncontested election has no candidates, then any player CAN
      declare the election ended with no winner by announcement.
      
      When a player wins an election, e is installed into the associated
      office and the election ends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2573/3 (Power=2)
Impeachment

      Any player CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, expel (impeach) the holder
      of a specified elected office. When a person is impeached from an
      office, an election is immediately opened for that office. Players
      SHOULD NOT use this method of removal unless the officer has
      abused the powers of eir office or otherwise shown emself unworthy
      of the trust of Agora.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2160/24 (Power=3)
Deputisation

      A player acting as emself (the deputy) CAN perform an action
      ordinarily reserved for an office-holder as if e held the office
      if all of the following are true:
      
       1) The rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of
          holding that office, to perform the action. (This requirement
          is fulfilled by the deputy performing the action.)
      
       2) It would be POSSIBLE for the deputy to perform the action,
          other than by deputisation, if e held the office.
      
       3) The deputy, when performing the action, announces that e is
          doing so by deputisation or by temporary deputisation.
      
       4) The deputy has not held the office in the past 7 days.
      
      (If the office is vacant, then the remaining items in this list
      need not be true.)
      
       5) A time limit by which the rules require the action to be
          performed has expired.
      
       6) The office's holder has not changed in the past 7 days.
      
       7) Any of the following are true:
      
          a) The deputy announced between 2 and 14 days earlier that
             e intended to deputise for that office for the purposes of
             the particular action.
      
          b) The time limit expired between 14 and 28 days ago.
      
          c) The time limit expired more than 28 days ago, and the
             deputisation is temporary.
      
      When a player deputises for an elected office, e becomes the
      holder of that office, unless the deputisation is temporary,
      and/or the action being performed would already install someone
      into that office.

Rule 2138/26 (Power=1)
The Associate Director of Personnel

      The Associate Director of Personnel (ADoP) is an office; its
      holder is responsible for keeping track of officers.
      
      The ADoP's report includes the following:
      
      1. The date of the last change (if any) to each office's
         Officeholder.
      2. The current status of the ongoing election for that office or,
         if there is no ongoing election for that office, the date on
         which the last election ended
      3. For filled elected offices, whether or not the holder is
         interim.
      4. For offices with a weekly and/or monthly report, the date (if
         any) that each was most recently published.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2472/5 (Power=2)
Office Incompatibilities

      Some pairs of office are incompatible:
      
      1. Prime Minister and Speaker
      
      2. Promotor and Assessor
      
      3. Assessor and ADoP
      
      4. Referee and Arbitor
      
      A player is Overpowered if e holds two offices which are
      incompatible with each other. Rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, a player CANNOT be installed into an office if
      doing so would make em Overpowered.
      
      If a player is Overpowered, any player CAN, with Notice, Demand
      Resignation from em. When this occurs, each office that the
      Overpowered player holds becomes vacant.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2143/37 (Power=1)
Official Reports and Duties

      For each person:
      
      1. If any task is defined by the rules as part of that person's
         weekly duties, then e SHALL perform it at least once each week.
         If any information is defined by the rules as part of that
         person's weekly report, then e SHALL maintain all such
         information, and the publication of all such information is
         part of eir weekly duties.
      
      2. If any task is defined by the rules as part of that person's
         monthly duties, then e SHALL perform it at least once each
         month. If any information is defined by the rules as part of
         that person's monthly report, then e SHALL maintain all such
         information, and the publication of all such information is
         part of eir monthly duties.
      
      Any information defined by the rules as part of a person's report,
      without specifying which one, is part of eir weekly report.
      Failure of a person to perform any weekly duty required of em
      within the allotted time is the Class 1+N infraction of Weekly
      Tardiness, where N is the number of times e has previously
      committed the infraction in the last month.
      
      Failure of a person to perform any monthly duty required of em
      within the allotted time is the Class 3 infraction of Monthly
      Tardiness.
      
      An official duty for an office is any duty that the Rules
      specifically assign to that office's holder in particular
      (regardless of eir identity).
      
      An officer SHALL publish eir report in plain text, with tabular
      data lining up properly when viewed in a monospaced font.
      Publishing a report that deviates from these restrictions is the
      Class 2 infraction of Making My Eyes Bleed.
      
      A player CAN, by announcement, petition a specified non-vacant
      office to take a specific action. The holder of that office SHALL
      publicly respond to that petition in a timely fashion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2677/0 (Power=0.5)
Etiquette

      Officers SHOULD:
      
       - publish dates in YYYY-MM-DD or DD Mon YY format in reports,
         whichever is more fitting to the situation;
      
       - communicate a schedule of when regularly timed duties will
         usually be done;
      
       - maintain an online version of eir report(s) in a browser-native
         format (such as html); AND
      
       - maintain a repository of eir report(s) in a public place.
      
      Players SHOULD:
      
       - signal the official name of the primary action and/or the
         relevant officer that tracks said actions in the title of a
         public message; AND
      
       - be kind.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2667/0 (Power=1)
Succumbing to Time

      Once per month, a player CAN Succumb by announcement. When a
      player Succumbs, each of eir deadlines to perform an Officer's
      duty or judge a Call for Judgement is extended by 1 day if it
      would otherwise expire within the next week.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2632/3 (Power=2.0)
Complexity

      Complexity is an office switch reflecting how complex it is to
      fulfill the duties of its office. Its possible values are all
      integers from 0 to 3 inclusive, where 1 is the default. It is
      tracked in the ADoP's weekly report. The ADoP CAN, with 2 Agoran
      consent, flip the complexity of an office to a specified possible
      value.
      
      For each office a player holds, eir voting strength is increase
      by the complexity of the office for referenda on ordinary
      proposals, up to a maximum increase of 3 by this method.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2603/0 (Power=1)
Switch Responsiblity

      For each type of switch which would otherwise lack an officer to
      track it, and is not defined as untracked, there exists an imposed
      office named “Tracker of [switch name]” that is responsible for
      tracking that switch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2379/0 (Power=1)
No News Is Some News

      If the rules define a report as including a list, then while that
      list is empty, that report includes the fact that it is empty.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2616/0 (Power=1.0)
The Webmastor

      The Webmastor is an office.
      
      The Webmastor's monthly report includes a Directory, a Changelog,
      a Warning Log, and an Error Log. The Directory lists notable
      currently maintained public resources. The Changelog lists notable
      changes to resources. The Warning Log lists notable potential
      issues, such as inaccurate or aging resources or unintended issues
      with a public resource. The Error Log lists notable losses of
      resources - where a resource has become inaccessible,
      unmaintained, or unusable. Where 'notable' is used in this rule
      its meaning is up to the Webmastor's discretion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Documents
   Documents are little bits of text that can be ratified, therefore
   modifying the gamestate slightly.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1551/22 (Power=3.2)
Ratification

      A retroactive change is one that changes the game's record of past
      events. Retroactive changes are secured with power threshold 3.
      
      When a document or statement (hereafter "document") is to be
      ratified, the following definitions apply:
      * The publication time is the instant at which the document to be
        ratified was published.
      * The truth time is the instant at which the document specifies
        that it was true, or the publication time if such an instant is
        not specified.
      * The application time is the instant at which the document to be
        ratified is ratified.
      
      Ratification CANNOT occur if the truth time would be after the
      application time, or if the publication time would be after the
      application time.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, when a document is
      ratified, the gamestate is modified to what it would be if, at the
      truth time, the gamestate had been minimally modified to make the
      ratified document as true and accurate as possible.
      
      Ratification CANNOT occur if it would add inconsistencies between
      the gamestate and the rules.
      
      Ratification CANNOT occur if the required modification to the
      gamestate is not possible or if multiple substantially distinct
      possible modifications would be equally appropriate.
      
      If the minimal modification would include past or present rule
      changes, they are instead excluded unless the ratified document
      explicitly and unambiguously recites either the changes or the
      resulting properties of the rule(s).
      
      An internally inconsistent document generally CANNOT be ratified;
      however, if such a document can be divided into a summary section
      and a main section, where the only purpose of the summary section
      is to summarize information in the main section, and the main
      section is internally consistent, ratification of the document
      proceeds as if it contained only the main section.
      
      Text purportedly about previous instances of ratification (e.g. a
      report's date of last ratification) is excluded from ratification.
      The rules may define additional information that is considered to
      be part of the document for the purposes of ratification; such
      definitions are secured with power threshold 3.
      
      Ratification is secured with power threshold 3.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2202/10 (Power=3)
Ratification Without Objection

      A public document is part (possibly all) of a public message.
      
      A player CAN, without objection, ratify a specified public
      document.
      
      Ratification Without Objection CANNOT cause the repeal, amendment,
      enactment, or mutation of any Rule, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding.
      
      A player SHALL NOT knowingly use or announce intent to use
      Ratification Without Objection to ratify a (prior to ratification)
      document containing incorrect or Indeterminate information when a
      corrected document could be produced with reasonable effort,
      unless the general nature of the document's error and reason for
      ratifying it is clearly and plainly described in the announcement
      of intent. Such ratification or announcement of intent to ratify
      is the Class 8 Infraction of Endorsing Forgery.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2201/10 (Power=3)
Self-Ratification

      When a public document is continuously undoubted for one week
      after publication:
      
      - If the rules define it as self-ratifying, it is ratified.
      
      - If the rules define it as a self-ratifying attestation to a
        given statement, the statement is ratified.
      
        This clause is inapplicable if the statement to be ratified
        cannot be reasonably ascertained from the ruleset and the
        contents of the message.
      
      Any person CAN by announcement issue a doubt (syn. claim of
      error), identifying a document and explaining the scope and nature
      of a perceived error in it (or in a statement it attests to).
      
      When this happens, the publisher of the original document SHALL
      (if e was required to publish that document) or SHOULD (otherwise)
      do one of the following in a timely fashion, in an announcement
      that clearly cites the claim of error:
      
         1. Deny the claim (causing it to cease to be a doubt).
      
         2. Publish a revision.
      
         3. Initiate an inquiry case regarding the truth of the claim
            (if the subject is actually a matter of law), or cite a
            relevant existing inquiry case.

Justice
   So you've broken a rule. Now what? This section describes Blots, the
   main method of punishment for Agorans.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2555/12 (Power=2)
Blots

      Blots are an indestructible fixed currency with ownership
      restricted to persons. A person with 1 or more blots is Impure, a
      person with 0 blots is Pure. An impure unregistered person is a
      Fugitive. The Referee is an office, and the recordkeepor for
      blots.
      
      To expunge a blot is to destroy it. Creating and destroying blots
      is secured with a Power Threshold of 1.7
      
      A person CAN, by announcement, create a specified number of blots
      in eir possession.
      
      Any player who has not expunged a blot by this method this week
      CAN expunge 1 blot from a specified player by announcement. E
      CANNOT specify emself for this if e has gained any blots this or
      the previous week.
      
      At the beginning of each quarter, half (rounded down) of each
      fugitive's blots are destroyed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2556/1 (Power=3)
Penalties

      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, an impure person CANNOT win
      the game.
      
      The voting strength of a player on an Agoran decision is reduced
      by 1 for every 3 blots in eir possession.
      
      A player CAN, with 7 days notice, deregister (exile) a specified
      player (the outlaw) who has more than 40 blots.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2478/24 (Power=1.7)
Justice

      An Infraction is a violation of a rule. The person who committed
      an infraction is its infracter.
      
      The Investigator for an infraction is the Referee unless e is the
      infracter. Otherwise, it is the Arbitor.
      
      The Class of an infraction is 2 unless a rule specifies a
      different Class for it.
      
      The Base of an infraction is N, where N is the number of
      previously-investigated, unforgiven infractions that have been
      committed by the same person in the last 30 days. The previous
      notwithstanding, if the base of an infraction would be greater
      than its class, the infraction's base is equal to its class.
      
      Within 14 days of an infraction being committed, the Investigator
      CAN investigate the infraction by announcement, specifying a
      number of blots between the Base and the Class of the infraction,
      inclusive. When e does so, that many blots are created in the
      possession of the infracter.
      
      The previous notwithstanding, an Investigator CANNOT investigate
      an infraction that has already been investigated or forgiven. The
      Investigator of a noted, unforgiven infraction SHALL investigate
      the infraction in a timely manner after it has been noted;
      failure to do so is the Class N crime of Favoritism, where N is
      equal to the Class of the noted infraction.
      
      A player CAN, by announcement, "note" an unforgiven infraction
      committed by any other player in the last 7 days, specifying the
      incident and the rule it violates (or name of the Infraction if
      it has one).
      
      The Referee's weekly report contains a list of noted and
      investigated Infractions committed in the previous week.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2676/0 (Power=1.7)
Forgiveness

      All infractions that have not been forgiven are unforgiven.
      
      Any player CAN, with Agoran Consent, "forgive" an unforgiven
      infraction that occured in the last 30 days. When an infraction
      is forgiven, if the infraction was investigated, a number of
      blots in the possession of the infracter equal to the number of
      blots specified by the investigation are destroyed or, if e has
      less blots than specified, all eir blots are destroyed. The
      previous notwithstanding, a player cannot forgive or support an
      intent to forgive eir own infraction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2531/16 (Power=2)
Defendant's Rights

      An infraction is automatically forgiven if:
      
      (1) the alleged infracter can't be established by a preponderance
          of the evidence to have committed the infraction
      
      (2) at the time the alleged infraction occured, it was not an
          infraction;
      
      (3) the infraction was for failure to take an action that the
          infracter, through no fault of eir own, COULD NOT have
          performed;
      
      (4) the infraction is for conduct that the infracter, through no
          fault of eir own, was obliged to undertake by a rule of equal
          or greater power to the one e violated; or
      
      (5) the infracter could not have avoided the infraction when
          exercising the highest reasonably possible standard of care;

========================================================================
Calls for Judgement
   What if there is a rule conflict? What if we can't decide what a rule
   means? Well then, it's time to call a CFJ.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 991/33 (Power=2)
Calls for Judgement

      Any person (the initiator) can initiate a Call for Judgement (CFJ,
      syn. Judicial Case), specifying a statement to be inquired into by
      announcement.
      
      When a person initiates a Call for Judgement, e CAN optionally bar
      one person from the case by announcement.
      
      At any time, each CFJ is either open (default), suspended, or
      assigned exactly one judgement that was validly assigned.
      
      The Arbitor is an office, responsible for the administration of
      justice in a manner that is fair for emself, if not for the rest
      of Agora.
      
      Judge is an untracked CFJ switch with possible values of any
      person or former person, or "unassigned" (default). To "assign" a
      CFJ to a person is to flip that CFJ's judge to that person.  To
      "remove" or "recuse" a person from a being the judge of a CFJ is
      to flip that CFJ's judge from that person to unassigned.
      
      When an open CFJ's judge is unassigned, the Arbitor CAN assign any
      eligible player to be its judge by announcement, and SHALL do so
      in a timely fashion after it becomes an open and unassigned CFJ.
      The players eligible to be assigned as judge are all active
      players except the initiator and the person barred (if any). The
      Arbitor SHALL assign judges over time such that all interested
      players have reasonably equal opportunities to judge.  If a CFJ
      has no judge assigned, then any player eligible to judge that CFJ
      CAN assign it to emself without 3 objections.
      
      The Arbitor's weekly report includes a summary of recent judicial
      case activity, including open and recently-judged cases, recent
      judicial assignments, and a list of players interested in judging.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 591/50 (Power=1.7)
Delivering Judgements

      When a CFJ is open and assigned to a judge, that judge CAN assign
      a valid judgement to it by announcement, and SHALL do so in a
      timely fashion after this becomes possible.
      
      The valid judgements for an inquiry case are as follows, based on
      the facts and legal situation at the time the inquiry case was
      initiated, not taking into account any events since that time:
      
      * FALSE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
        logically false.
      
      * TRUE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
        logically true.
      
      * IRRELEVANT, appropriate if the veracity of the statement is
        not relevant to the game or is an overly hypothetical
        extrapolation of the game or its rules to conditions that don't
        actually exist, or if it can be trivially determined from the
        outcome of another (possibly still undecided) judicial case that
        was not itself judged IRRELEVANT.
      
      * INSUFFICIENT, appropriate if the statement does not come
        with supporting arguments or evidence, and the judge feels as if
        an undue burden is being placed on em by the lack of arguments
        and evidence. A CFJ judged as INSUFFICIENT SHOULD be submitted
        again with sufficient arguments/evidence.
      
      * DISMISS, appropriate if the statement is malformed, undecidable,
        if insufficient information exists to make a judgement with
        reasonable effort, or the statement is otherwise not able to be
        answered with another valid judgement. DISMISS is not
        appropriate if PARADOXICAL is appropriate.
      
      * PARADOXICAL, appropriate if the statement is logically
        undecidable as a result of a paradox or or other irresolvable
        logical situation. PARADOXICAL is not appropriate if IRRELEVANT
        is appropriate, nor is it appropriate if the undecidability
        arises from the case itself or in reference to it.
      
      If the judge of an open CFJ has not violated a time limit for
      assigning it a judgement, and has not previously filed a motion to
      either extend or reconsider the case, e CAN file a motion to
      extend the case by announcement. Doing so extends eir judgement
      deadline for that case by one week. In doing so, e SHOULD include
      a (nonbinding) draft or outline of eir current thoughts on the
      case.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 911/55 (Power=1.7)
Motions and Moots

      If a judgement has been in effect for less then seven days and has
      not been entered into Moot, then:
      
      - The judge of that CFJ CAN self-file a Motion to Reconsider the
        case by announcement, if e has not already self-filed a Motion
        to Reconsider that CFJ.
      - Any Player CAN group-file a Motion to Reconsider the case with 2
        support, if the CFJ has not had a Motion to Reconsider
        group-filed for it at any time while it has been assigned to its
        current judge.
      
      When a Motion to Reconsider is so filed, the case is rendered open
      again.
      
      If a CFJ has a judgement assigned, a player CAN enter that
      judgement into Moot with N+2 support, where N is the number of
      weeks since that judgement has been assigned, rounded down. When
      this occurs, the CFJ is suspended, and the Arbitor is once
      authorized to initiate the Agoran decision to determine public
      confidence in the judgement, which e SHALL do in a timely fashion.
      
      For this decision, the vote collector is the Arbitor and the valid
      options are AFFIRM, REMAND, and REMIT. When the decision is
      resolved, the effect depends on the outcome:
      
      - AFFIRM, FAILED QUORUM: The judgement is reassigned to the case,
        and cannot be entered into Moot again.
      
      - REMAND: The case becomes open again.
      
      - REMIT: The case becomes open again, and the current judge is
        recused. The Arbitor SHALL NOT assign em to the case again
        unless no other eligible judges have displayed interest in
        judging.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2175/9 (Power=1)
Judicial Retraction and Excess

      A new case is a judicial case that has not had any judge assigned
      to it. The initiator of a new case CAN retract it by announcement,
      thus causing it to cease to be a judicial case.
      
      An excess case is a new case whose initiator previously initiated
      five or more cases during the same week as that case. A person
      SHALL NOT initiate an excess case. The Arbitor CAN refuse an
      excess case by announcement, thus causing it to cease to be a
      judicial case. When e does so, e fulfills any obligations with
      regards to that case.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2492/6 (Power=1)
Recusal

      A judge CAN recuse emself from a CFJ e is assigned to by
      announcement.
      
      The Arbitor CAN recuse a judge from a case by announcement, if
      that judge has violated a time limit for judging the case and has
      not judged it in the mean time; the Arbitor SHALL do so in a
      timely fashion after the time limit expires, if able. The Arbitor
      CAN recuse an inactive or deregistered judge by announcement.
      
      If a judge is recused from a case that was continuously open and
      assigned to em for at least the past 4 days, e SHOULD NOT be
      assigned as a judge until e has apologised and/or reasonably
      explained eir actions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2246/7 (Power=2)
Submitting a CFJ to the Referee

      When a person initiates a Call for Judgement, e CAN, optionally,
      submit it to the Referee by announcement. All persons are
      ENCOURAGED to submit a case to the Referee only when there is a
      good reason not to let it be processed by the Arbitor as usual.
      
      When a CFJ is submitted to the Referee, the Referee receives all
      obligations and powers, other than obligations to report, for that
      case that the Arbitor would otherwise receive due to being
      Arbitor. This rule takes precedence over Rules that would
      otherwise assign duties and powers regarding to a judicial case to
      the Arbitor.

   Pledges and Contracts.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2471/3 (Power=1)
No Faking

      A person SHALL NOT make a public statement that is a lie.
      
      A public statement is falsy if any of the following was true at
      the time of publication:
      * The statement was not true and the author knew or should have
        known that it was not true.
      * The author believed the statement to be not true.
      
      A public statement is a lie if it is falsy and any of the
      following is true:
      * The author made the statement with intent to mislead.
      * The author, in the same message, declared the statement to be
        made "under penalty of No Faking" (or similar).
      
      For the purposes of this rule, an attempt to perform an action by
      publishing certain text constitutes an implicit statement that the
      action was EFFECTIVE.
      
      Merely quoting a statement or attempt does not constitute making
      it for the purposes of this rule. Any disclaimer, conditional
      clause, or other qualifier attached to a statement or attempt
      constitutes part of the statement or attempt for the purposes of
      this rule; the truth or falsity of the whole is what is
      significant.
      
      The above notwithstanding, a formal announcement of intent is
      never a lie.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2450/11 (Power=1.7)
Pledges

      If a consenting Player makes a clear public pledge (syn. Oath) to
      perform (or refrain from performing) certain actions, then
      breaking the pledge is ILLEGAL; doing so is the Class N infraction
      of Oathbreaking, where N is the value explicitly stated by the
      pledge, or 2 if the pledge does not explicitly state a value.
      Allowing a pledge to expire without carrying out an action one
      pledged to do in it constitutes breaking the pledge.
      
      The time window of a pledge is W days, where W is the value
      explicitly stated by the pledge, or 60 if the pledge does not
      explicitly state a value. A pledge ceases to exist at the end of
      its time window.
      
      If breaking the pledge harms specific other parties, the Referee
      SHOULD solicit the opinion of those parties in determining an
      appropriate fine.
      
      The Notary CAN destroy a pledge Without Objection, but SHOULD NOT
      do so unless the pledge no longer serves any significant purpose.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2466/3 (Power=3)
Acting on Behalf

      When a rule allows one person (the agent) to act on behalf of
      another (the principal) to perform an action, that agent CAN
      perform the action if it is POSSIBLE for the principal to do so,
      taking into account any prerequisites for the action. If the
      enabling rule does not specify the mechanism by which the agent
      may do so, then the agent CAN perform the action in the same
      manner in which the principal CAN do so, with the additional
      requirement that the agent must, in the message in which the
      action is performed, uniquely identify the principal and that the
      action is being taken on behalf of that person.
      
      A person SHALL NOT act on behalf of another person if doing so
      causes the second person to violate the rules. A person CANNOT act
      on behalf of another person to do anything except perform a game
      action; in particular, a person CANNOT act on behalf of another
      person to send a message, only to perform specific actions that
      might be taken within a message, including actions that would
      otherwise be taken by publishing certain text.
      
      When an action is performed on behalf of a principal, then the
      action is considered for all game purposes to have been performed
      by the principal, unless a rule specifically states that it is
      treated differently for some purpose, in which case it is treated
      as described by that rule.
      
      Allowing a person to act on behalf of another person is secured at
      power 2.0. This rule takes precedence over any rule that would
      prohibit a person from taking an action, except that it defers to
      any rule that imposes limitations specifically on actions taken on
      behalf of another person.
      
      An agent CANNOT act on behalf of a principal to perform an action
      via a specific method if the rules state that the actor acts "as
      emself" or "on eir own behalf" to perform the action via that
      method.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2618/6 (Power=2.2)
Promises

      Promises are a class of assets, tracked by the Notary. Their
      essential attributes are their text and creator. A consenting
      player CAN, by announcement, grant a specified entity a promise,
      specifying its text and becoming its creator. A promise's owner is
      referred to as its bearer. Promises with the same text, creator,
      and bearer are fungible. Promises with the same text and creator
      SHOULD be referred to by the same title, but the title is not an
      essential attribute of the promise, just a way of referring to it.
      
      The creation of promises is secured. The text of a promise CANNOT
      be altered after it is created.
      
      A promise's bearer CAN, by announcement, cash the promise,
      provided that any conditions for cashing it specified by its text
      are unambiguously met. By doing so, e acts on the creator of the
      promise's behalf, causing the creator to act as if e published the
      promise's text, and destroys the promise. However, to limit
      recursion, no promise can be cashed during the execution of
      another promise unless it existed before the execution of that
      promise began. The bearer SHOULD recite the promise's essential
      attributes in the same message e cashes it.
      
      In a promise's text, "the bearer" (or the like) refers to the
      promise's bearer, and "this promise" (or the like) refers to the
      promise. The text of the promise can refer to the context of the
      message in which it is cashed, but the context of the message does
      not otherwise change the meaning of the promise.
      
      The Library is an entity and CAN own promises. Any player CAN take
      a specified promise from the Library by announcement, provided e
      cashes the promise in the same message.
      
      The creator of a promise CAN take or revoke it from the Library by
      announcement, unless the promise's text unambiguously designates
      it as irrevocable. Any player CAN revoke a specified promise from
      the Library without objection. If a promise specifies expiration
      conditions then any player CAN by announcement destroy it while
      the expiration conditions are unambiguously met.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2519/2 (Power=3)
Consent

      A person is deemed to have consented to an action if and only if,
      at the time the action took place:
      
      1. e, acting as emself, has publicly stated that e agrees to the
         action and not subsequently publicly withdrawn eir statement;
      2. e is party to a contract whose body explicitly and
          unambiguously indicates eir consent;
      3. the action is taken as part of a promise which e created; or
      4. it is reasonably clear from context that e wanted the action to
         take place or assented to it taking place.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1742/23 (Power=2.5)
Contracts

      Any group of one or more consenting persons (the parties) may
      publicly make an agreement among themselves with the intention
      that it be binding upon them and be governed by the rules. Such
      an agreement is known as a contract. A contract may be modified,
      including by changing the set of parties, with the consent of all
      existing parties. A contract may also be terminated with the
      consent of all parties. A contract automatically terminates if the
      number of parties to it falls below one. It is IMPOSSIBLE for a
      person to become a party to a contract without eir consent.
      
      Parties to a contract governed by the rules SHALL act in
      accordance with that contract. This obligation is not impaired
      by contradiction between the contract and any other contract, or
      between the contract and the rules.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any change that would cause
      the full provisions or parties of a contract to become publicly
      unavailable is canceled and does not take effect.
      
      The portion of a contract's provisions that can be interpreted
      with reference only to information that is either publicly or
      generally available are known as its body; the remainder of the
      provisions are known as the annex.
      
      A party to a contract CAN perform any of the following actions as
      explicitly and unambiguously permitted by the contract's body:
      
      * Act on behalf of another party to the contract.
      
      * By announcement, revoke destructible assets from the contract.
      
      * By announcement, transfer liquid assets from the contract to a
        specified recipient.
      
      Any player CAN cause a contract to be terminated (syn. "shred")
      without 2 objections. This SHOULD only be done to remove unused
      contracts or contracts deemed detrimental to the game as a whole.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2608/4 (Power=2.0)
The Notary

      The Notary is an office.
      
      The Notary's monthly report contains:
      
      1. every pledge, along with its title, creator, time window, time
         of creation, and time of expiry;
      2. every contract, with its title, full provisions, and parties;
         and
      3. every promise, along with its title, text, creator, and bearer.
      
      If the Notary is required to report an entity's title, but none
      has been otherwise publicly provided, e CAN assign one by public
      designation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Assets
   Assets are things players can own. This section describes how that
   works.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2166/31 (Power=3)
Assets

      An asset is an entity defined as such by a document that has been
      granted Mint Authority by the Rules (hereafter the asset's backing
      document), and existing solely because its backing document
      defines its existence. An asset's backing document can generally
      specify when and how that asset is created, destroyed, and
      transferred.
      
      The rules collectively have Mint Authority. Contracts have Mint
      Authority. An asset defined by rule or regulation is public; any
      other asset is private.
      
      The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity (if any)
      defined as such by, and bound by, its backing document. That
      entity's report includes a list of all instances of that class and
      their owners. A public document purporting to be this portion of
      that entity's report is self-ratifying.
      
      For a class of assets to be "tracked by" an entity is for that
      entity to be its recordkeepor.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2576/3 (Power=3)
Ownership

      Each asset has exactly one owner.
      
      If ownership of an asset is restricted to a class of entities,
      then that asset CANNOT be gained by or transferred to an entity
      outside that class. By default, ownership of an asset is
      restricted to Agora, players, and contracts, but an asset's
      backing document may modify this.
      
      An asset "in abeyance" is one whose owner is nonexistent,
      indeterminate, or invalid. If an asset would otherwise be in
      abeyance, then it is owned by the Lost and Found Department (if
      possible) or destroyed (otherwise), subject to modification by its
      backing document (provided that the modification either destroys
      it or prevents it from being in abeyance). Rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the Lost and Found Department can own assets of
      every type. Assets owned by the Lost and Found Department can be
      transferred or destroyed by any player without objection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2577/8 (Power=3)
Asset Actions

      An asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner by announcement,
      subject to modification by its backing document. Attempts to
      destroy no assets are successful. An indestructible asset is one
      defined as such by its backing document, and CANNOT be destroyed
      except as explicitly specified by its backing document; any other
      asset is destructible.
      
      For an entity to gain (historical syn. earn) an asset is for that
      asset to be created in that entity's possession. To grant an
      entity an asset is to create it in eir possession. To grant an
      entity a set of assets is to create each asset in the set in eir
      possession.
      
      For an entity to lose an asset is for that asset to be destroyed
      from that entity's possession. To revoke an asset from an entity
      is to destroy it from that entity's possession.
      
      For entity A to take an asset from entity B is to transfer it from
      entity B to entity A.
      
      An asset generally CAN be transferred (syn. given) by announcement
      by its owner to another entity, subject to modification by its
      backing document. Attempts to transfer no assets are successful. A
      fixed asset is one defined as such by its backing document, and
      CANNOT be transferred except as explicitly specified by its
      backing document; any other asset is liquid.
      
      When a rule indicates creating, destroying, or transferring an
      amount of assets that is not a natural number, the specified
      amount is rounded up to the nearest natural number after all other
      calculations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2578/1 (Power=3)
Currencies

      A currency is a class of asset defined as such by its backing
      document. Instances of a currency with the same owner are
      fungible.
      
      The "x balance of an entity", where x is a currency, is the number
      of x that entity possesses. Where it resolves ambiguity, the asset
      or currency being referred to is the currency designated as
      the official currency of Agora, if there is one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2579/3 (Power=3)
Fee-based Actions

      If the Rules associate payment of a set of assets (hereafter the
      fee for the action; syns: cost, price, charge) with performing an
      action, that method for performing that action is a fee-based
      method.
      
      If the fee is a non-integer quantity of a fungible asset, the
      actual fee is the next highest integer amount of that asset.
      
      To use a fee-based method, an entity (the Actor) who is otherwise
      permitted to perform the action must announce that e is performing
      the action; the announcement must specify the correct set of
      assets for the fee and indicate intent to pay that fee for the
      sole purpose of using that method to perform that action.
      
      Upon such an announcement:
      
        - If the Rules specify a recipient for the fee, and the Actor
          CAN transfer that specified fee from emself to the recipient,
          then that fee is transferred from the Actor to the recipient
          and the action is performed simultaneously;
      
        - If the Rules do not specify a recipient, and the Actor CAN
          destroy the specified fee in eir possession, then that fee in
          eir possession is destroyed and the action is performed
          simultaneously.
      
        - Otherwise, no changes are made to asset holdings and the
          action is not performed.

   we give to them, though, they all function similarly. This section

Rule 2659/4 (Power=1)
Stamps

      Stamps are a category of asset ownable by players . The
      Collector is an office. The Collector tracks Stamps in eir weekly
      report.
      
      For each person there is a corresponding type of stamp. Stamps of
      any given type are a currency.
      
      Any player CAN, once per week, pay X Stamps, where each specified
      Stamp is a different type, to gain (X^2)-X radiance.
      
      Any player CAN, once per week, pay X Stamps, where each Stamp is
      the same type, to gain (X-1)*2 radiance.
      
      Any player CAN win by paying N Stamps, where N is the current
      number of active players and each specified Stamp is of a
      different type.

Rule 2499/21 (Power=1)
Welcome Packages

      A Welcome Package is a set of assets containing:
      
      * 1 Stamp of eir own type
      
      Any player CAN, by announcement, grant a Welcome Package to any
      player if the grantee has neither received one since e last
      registered nor in the last 30 days.

Birthday Gifts

      It is considered to be a player's Agoran Birthday on the
      anniversary of the day e first registered. If the day a player
      first registered is unknown, that player CAN, with Agoran consent,
      declare a day to be eir Agoran Birthday. As long as the day a
      player first registered remains unknown, it is considered to be
      eir Agoran Birthday on the anniversary of the day e most recently
      declared as eir Agoran Birthday.
      
      In a timely manner after the start of a player's Agoran Birthday,
      the Registrar SHALL announce it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2675/8 (Power=2)
Dream of Wandering

      The Dream Keeper is an office; its holder is responsible for
      keeping track of the dreams of all active players.
      
      Dream is a secured active player switch, tracked by the Dream
      Keeper in eir weekly report, with possible values any Dream,
      defaulting to Wandering. An "X Dreamer" is a player with eir Dream
      switch set to X.
      
      An active player CAN "envision" eir own Dream, specifying any
      valid value for eir Dream, by announcement. When the rules state
      that the wandering occurs, every active player's Dream is set to
      the value e most recently envisioned. If a player did not envision
      a dream since the last wandering, it is not flipped.
      
      A wandering occurs at the beginning of each week.
      
      The following is an exhaustive list of all Dreams and the rules
      relevant to each dream:
      
      - Wandering: This dream has no effect.
      
      - Charity: Immediately after a wandering, one stamp (chosen by
        most-to-least owned by the L&FD at time of transfer, tie-broken
        alphabetically) is transferred to each Charity Dreamer (in order
        from least-to-most stamps owned, tie-broken alphabetically) from
        the L&FD. If the number of Stamps the L&FD owned during the last
        wandering is greater than 10, this process happens a second
        time. If it is more than 20, this process happens a third time.
      
      - Justice: Immediately after a wandering, 1 blot is expunged from
        each Justice Dreamer. If a Justice Dreamer had no blots
        immediately after a wandering, e CAN once expunge one blot, by
        announcement, from a specified player before the next wandering.
      
      - Sharing: Immediately after a wandering, each Sharing Dreamer has
        eir points increased by X / Y, rounded down, where X is half the
        number of active players, rounded up, and Y is the number of
        Sharing Dreamers.
      
      - Wealth: Immediately after a wandering, X stamps of eir own type
        are granted to each Wealth Dreamer. When less than 8 Stamps of
        eir type exist, X is 2. When 8 to 15 Stamps of eir type exist, X
        is 1. When 16 ore more Stamps of eir type exist, X is 0.
      
      - Gardens: Immediately after a wandering, the Base Rockiness of
        each Gardens Dreamer is increased by 1.
      
      - Power: Each Power Dreamer has eir voting strength increased by 2
        for referenda on ordinary proposals.
      
      - Revolution: A revolution is happening if the majority of active
        players are Revolution Dreamers. Immediately after a wandering,
        if a revolution is not happening, then all Revolution Dreamers
        have eir radiance decreased by 1 to a minimum of 0. Immediately
        after a wandering, if a revolution is happening, then all
        players have eir radiance set to 100-X, where X was eir radiance
        when the wandering occured, and all player's Dreams are set to
        Wandering.

Stones
   A game in which people try to collect Stones with various different
   Magical Powers OooOooh!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2640/4 (Power=2)
Stones

      A stone is a unique indestructible liquid asset defined by the
      rules. To define a stone, the definition must include:
        (i) A name unique among stones;
       (ii) The smoothness of the stone, which is a non-negative integer;
      (iii) A description of the stone's properties
       (iv) Optionally, a frequency, which must be one of daily, weekly,
            monthly, or quarterly.
      
      Ownership of stones is entirely restricted to Agora and active
      players.  If a stone is owned by the Lost and Found Department or
      in abeyance, it is immediately transferred to Agora.
      
      The Stonemason is an office, and the recordkeepor of stones.
      
      Mossiness is a Stone switch with values of non-negative integers
      and a default of 0 tracked by the Stonemason. When a stone is
      transferred from Agora to a player or from a player to Agora, its
      Mossiness is set to 0. The mossiest stone(s) in a set of stone is
      (are) the stone(s) with the highest Mossiness value.
      
      The Slipperiness of a stone is that stone's smoothness plus its
      mossiness.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2641/2 (Power=2)
Wielding Stones

      Except as otherwise specified by the rules, the owner of a stone
      CAN wield it by announcement specifying any values needed to
      interpret the stone's effects.
      
      A stone with a frequency that has been wielded in the corresponding
      Agoran time interval is Hot for the remainder of the time period
      (e.g. if the frequency is daily, it is hot for the remainder of the
      Agoran day it was wielded during).
      
      While a stone is hot, it is IMPOSSIBLE to wield it or to transfer
      it by announcement
      
      When a stone is wielded, the Rule defining that stone applies any
      effects that it defines as occurring when the stone is wielded.
      
      The wielding of stones is secured.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2642/6 (Power=2)
Gathering Stones

      Base Rockiness is an active player switch, with values of integers
      and default of 0, tracked by the Stonemason. A player's Modified
      Rockiness is eir Base Rockiness minus the number of stones e owns.
      
      Once a week each player CAN "reach" for a specified stone owned by
      Agora by announcement.
      
      At the beginning of each week, the stone specified by the player
      with the highest Modified Rockiness that reached for a stone in
      the previous week is transferred to em. In a tie, the stone
      specified by the tied player who reached first is transferred to
      em. When a player receives a stone in this way, eir Base Rockiness
      is set to 0.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2643/9 (Power=2)
Collecting Stones

      A stone is immune if and only if it is defined as such by the
      rules of power not less than 2.
      
      A stone is immune if it is owned by Agora. A stone is immune if it
      has been granted immunity since the last collection notice. The
      granting of immunity is secured.
      
      Once per month, the Stonemason CAN publish a Collection Notice by
      announcement, specifying all necessary information and choices. The
      Stonemason SHALL publish such a notice in a timely fashion after
      the beginning of each Agoran month.
      
      A Collection Notice includes a random integer from 1 to 6; this is
      the Escape Minimum.
      
      When a Collection Notice is published, for each player, half
      (rounded up) of eir non-immune stones with slipperiness not less
      than the Escape Minimum are transferred to Agora, rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding.  A Collection Notice includes selections
      of which eligible stones escape (which shall prevail in
      determining which stones are transferred). The mossiness of each
      stone that is not transferred is incremented by 1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2644/5 (Power=2)
Zen Gardening

      A player CAN, by announcement, Notice the Rock Garden, specifying
      a single player that owns 8 or more stones, provided that no
      person has won the game by doing so in the past 30 days.
      
      When the Rock Garden is Noticed, the specified player wins the
      game.  If a player won the game in this manner 4 days ago, then
      all existing stones are transferred to Agora.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2645/21 (Power=2)
The Stones

      The following stones are defined, one per paragraph, with the
      following format: Stone Name (Frequency, Smoothness): Description.
      
      - Power Stone (weekly, 2): When this stone is wielded, a specified
        player (defaulting to the wielder if not specified) is Power
        Stoned; Power Stoning is secured. A player's voting strength on
        a referendum on an ordinary proposal is increased by 3 for each
        time that e was Power Stoned during the referendum's voting
        period.
      
      - Soul Stone (weekly, 3): When wielded, this stone is transferred
        to the owner of a different specified non-immune stone not owned
        by Agora, then that stone is transferred to the wielder.
      
      - Sabotage Stone (weekly, 4): When wielded, the adoption index of
        a specified AI-majority Agoran decision is increased by 1.
      
      - Minty Stone (weekly, 4): When wielded, a specified Player gains
        a stamp of eir own type.
      
      - Protection Stone (monthly, 4): When wielded, a specified stone
        is granted immunity.
      
      - Recursion Stone (Monthly, 4): The Recursion Stone can be wielded
        once per month as if it had the power of any other stone of your
        choice (the Blueprint Stone), with any references to the
        Blueprint Stone itself changed to the Recursion Stone unless
        they specify otherwise.
      
      - Hot Potato Stone (Weekly, 5): When this stone is wielded, the
        wielder specifies an eligible player and gains 8 radiance. The
        stone is transferred to the eligible player. An eligible player
        is one who has not owned this stone since the last time Agora
        owned it. If this stone is not owned by Agora, a player CANNOT
        otherwise transfer it, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.
        This stone is immune if 3 or more players have wielded it since
        the most recent collection notice.
      
      - Blank Stone (Monthly, 0): This stone has no effect.
      
      - Anti-Equatorial Stone (Monthly, 5): When wielded, the mossiest
        non-immune stone is transferred to the wielder. If more than one
        such stone is tied for mossiest, a specified one is transferred.
        When this happens, the wielded stone's mossiness is incremented
        by 1.
      
      - Radiance Stone (Weekly, 3): When wielded, a specified player
        (defaulting to the wielder if not specified) gains 3 radiance.

========================================================================
Scoring
   A game in which players attempt attempt to amass points, in order to
   (presumably) become the Pointiest.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2656/5 (Power=1.5)
Radiance

      A player's Radiance is an integer player switch defaulting to 0,
      tracked by the Herald. When a player is "granted" or "gains" a
      specified amount of radiance, eir radiance is increased by that
      amount.
      
      Upon a correct announcement from a player that eir radiance is 100
      or more (correctly specifying the amount), e wins the game. Then,
      eir radiance is set to 0, and all other players' radiance are set
      to half their current value rounded down.
      
      At the start of every quarter, all radiance switches are set to
      half their current value rounded down.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Victory
   All games have winners, and Agora is no exception. If you're
   interested in getting some serious bragging points among the Agorans,
   this is the right place to look.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2449/3 (Power=3)
Winning the Game

      When the Rules state that a person or persons win the game, those
      persons win the game; specifically they win the Round that ends
      with the indicated win. Agora itself does not end and the ruleset
      remains unchanged. The Herald is then authorized to award those
      persons the Patent Title of Champion once, by announcement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2465/1 (Power=0.3)
Victory by Apathy

      A player CAN Declare Apathy without objection, specifying a set of
      players. Upon doing so, the specified players win the game, except
      for those who have won the game through this Rule in the past 14
      days.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2553/5 (Power=1)
Win by Paradox

      If a CFJ about the effectiveness, possibility, or legality of a
      change in the gamestate has been assigned a judgement of
      PARADOXICAL continuously for between 7 and 90 days, then that
      case's initiator, CAN, by announcement, Transcend Logic,
      specifying that CFJ, provided that e has not already won the game
      with respect to that CFJ. When a person transcends logic, e wins
      the game.
      
      A player who wins in this fashion SHOULD submit a proposal to
      prevent the paradox from arising again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Awards
   Even if it's not a win, there are still a good few opportunities to
   win bragging points, like Ribbons and Patent Titles.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2438/29 (Power=3)
Ribbons

      The Tailor is an office, and the recordkeepor of Ribbons.
      
      For each type of Ribbon, <type> Ribbon Ownership is a secured
      negative boolean person switch, tracked by the Tailor in eir
      monthly report. Laudability is a secured person switch with
      non-negative integer possible values, defaulting to 0, tracked by
      the Tailor as part of eir monthly report. When a person owns more
      types of ribbons than eir Laudability, eir Laudability is set to
      the number of types of ribbons e owns.
      
      To "award a person a <Ribbon type>" is to flip that person's
      <that type> Ribbon Ownership to True. A person "owns a <Ribbon
      type>" if eir <that type> Ribbon Ownership is True.
      
      A person qualifies for a type of Ribbon if e has earned that type
      of Ribbon within the preceding 7 days (including earlier in the
      same message).
      
      While a person owns all types of Ribbon, that person can Raise a
      Banner by announcement. This causes that person to win the game.
      When a person wins this way, for each type of Ribbon, that
      person's <type> Ribbon Ownership is flipped to False.
      
      The types of Ribbon, and the methods of obtaining them, are as
      follows:
      
      Red (R): When a proposal is adopted and changes at least one rule
      that, immediately before or after the change, has Power >= 3, its
      proposer earns a Red Ribbon.
      
      Orange (O): When a proposal is adopted via a referendum on which
      no valid ballots were AGAINST (after evaluating conditionals), its
      proposer earns an Orange Ribbon.
      
      Green (G): While a person holds an elected office, has done so
      continuously for the past 30 days, and has not failed to perform
      any duties of that office within the appropriate time limits
      during those 30 days, that person qualifies for a Green Ribbon.
      
      Emerald (E): When a person wins an election, e earns an Emerald
      Ribbon.
      
      Cyan (C): When a person deputises for an office, and that person
      has not held or deputised for that office within the past 7 days,
      that person earns a Cyan Ribbon.
      
      Blue (B): When a person assigns a judgement to a CFJ, and has
      never violated a time limit to assign a judgement to that CFJ,
      nor ever self-filed a motion to reconsider that CFJ, that person
      earns a Blue Ribbon.
      
      Magenta (M): When, during Agora's Birthday, a person publicly
      acknowledges it, that person earns a Magenta Ribbon.
      
      Ultraviolet (U): When a person is awarded the Patent Title
      Champion, that person earns an Ultraviolet Ribbon, unless the
      Champion title was awarded as the result of winning the game via
      this rule.
      
      Violet (V): When a person is awarded a Patent Title other than
      Champion or a degree, that person earns a Violet Ribbon.
      
      Indigo (I): When a person is awarded a degree, that person earns
      an Indigo Ribbon.
      
      Platinum (P): The Speaker qualifies for a Platinum Ribbon.
      
      Lime (L): A person qualifies for a Lime Ribbon if three or more
      proposals adopted in the preceding 7 days had that person as a
      coauthor.
      
      White (W): A player qualifies for a White Ribbon if e has never
      previously owned a White Ribbon (including under previous
      rulesets). A player who has been registered for the past 30+ days
      or 180+ cumulative days and has never acted on eir own behalf to
      cause another person to gain a White Ribbon (including under a
      previous ruleset) CAN act on eir own behalf to award a White
      Ribbon to another person by announcement.
      
      Black (K): An instrument CAN, as part of its effect, cause a
      person to earn a Black Ribbon. When this occurs, this Rule awards
      that person a Black Ribbon.
      
      Gray (A): The Tailor CAN award a Gray Ribbon by announcement,
      unless e has done so earlier in the month. E is ENCOURAGED to
      award such a Ribbon in the same message in which e publishes eir
      monthly report.
      
      Transparent (T): A person qualifies for a Transparent Ribbon while
      the number of other types of Ribbon that that person qualifies
      for, earns, and/or was awarded within the previous 7 days is at
      least 5.
      
      While a person qualifies for a type of Ribbon:
      
        - If e has not owned that type of Ribbon within the preceding 7
          days, any player CAN, by announcement, award em that type of
          Ribbon.
      
      Qualifying for ribbons is secured. Earning ribbons is secured.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2480/6 (Power=3.1)
Festivals

      Festivity is a secured singleton switch, whose possible values are
      integers ranging from 0 inclusive to the number of defined types
      of Ribbon exclusive, and defaulting to 0. Festivity is tracked in
      the Tailor's monthly report. In addition, while Festivity is
      non-zero, the Tailor SHALL announce its value each week; a public
      document purporting to be such an announcement is self-ratifying.
      
      If Agora's Festivity has had the same nonzero value for 14 days or
      more, or if it has a nonzero value and fewer than 5 players are
      Festive, then any player CAN flip it to 0 by announcement.
      
      A person whose Laudability is greater than or equal to Agora's
      Festivity is Festive. Any other person is not Festive.
      
      A player who would be Festive if the Festivity was N CAN Start a
      Rank N Festival, where N is an integer greater than Agora's
      Festivity, with 4 support from other players who would be Festive
      if the Festivity was N, except that a Rank N Festival CANNOT be
      started if Agora's Festivity has had a value grater than or equal
      to N in the past 21 days. Upon a Rank N Festival starting, Agora's
      Festivity is flipped to N.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2481/7 (Power=3.1)
Festival Restrictions

      While Agora's Festivity is nonzero, the following apply:
      
      1. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, non-Festive players
         CANNOT support/be a supporter for tabled action intents;
      
      2. Quorum for Agoran Decisions is equal to half the number of
         Festive players, rounded up;
      
      3. Each Festive player has the maximum possible voting strength.
         All other players have the minimum possible voting strength.
      
      While Agora's Festivity is zero, the paragraphs above have no
      effect and are ignored.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 649/44 (Power=1.5)
Patent Titles

      A Patent Title is a legal title held by an entity in recognition
      of eir distinction. The Herald is an office; its holder is
      responsible for tracking Patent Titles in eir monthly report.
      
      Awarding or revoking a Patent Title is secured at power 1. A
      person permitted and enabled to award (revoke) a Patent Title
      SHALL do so in a timely fashion after the conditions authorizing
      em to do so are announced, unless there is an open judicial case
      contesting the validity of those conditions.
      
      The Herald CAN award a specified Patent Title to a specified
      player with 2 Agoran consent. Any player CAN award a specified
      Patent Title to a specified player, as authorized by the Herald's
      Administrative Regulations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2415/1 (Power=1.5)
Badges

      A Badge is any patent title with the word 'badge' as part of its
      name. A badge SHOULD be used to award multiple persons for
      participating in specific event of note within Agora.  Any player
      CAN award a badge that does not yet exist to three or more persons
      simultaneously, with Agoran consent. The Herald CAN award an
      existing badge to persons without objection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1367/26 (Power=2)
Degrees

      Certain patent titles are known as degrees. The degrees are
      
      - Associate of Nomic Art             (A.N.A.)
      - Associate of Nomic                 (A.N.)
      - Juris Doctorate of Nomic           (J.N.)
      - Baccalaureate of Nomic Art         (B.N.A.)
      - Baccalaureate of Nomic             (B.N.)
      - Magisteriate of Nomic Art          (M.N.A.)
      - Magisteriate of Nomic              (M.N.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic Art             (D.N.Art.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic History         (D.N.Hist.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic Law             (D.N.Law.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic Science         (D.N.Sci.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic Philosophy      (D.N.Phil.)
      
      There are four classes of degrees, ranked in ascending order of
      merit: Associate degrees (A.N.A. and A.N.), Baccalaureate degrees
      (J.N through B.N.), Magisteriate degrees (M.N.A and M.N), and
      Doctorate degrees (D.N.Art. through D.N.Phil.).
      
      A specified degree CAN be awarded by any player other than the
      awardee, with 2 Agoran consent. It SHOULD only be awarded for the
      publication of an original thesis of scholarly worth (including
      responses to peer-review), published with explicit intent to
      qualify for a degree. The Herald SHOULD coordinate the peer-review
      process and the awarding of degrees.
      
      Degrees SHOULD be awarded according to the extent to which the
      thesis contributes to Nomic culture or thought: Associate degrees
      for an appreciable contribution, Baccalaureate degrees for a
      substantial contribution, Magisteriate degrees for a remarkable
      contribution, and Doctorate degrees for an exceptional
      contribution. Any degree at the Doctorate level SHOULD take into
      account the awardee's academic history and participation in Agora
      over time.
      
      Theses for Art degrees SHOULD demonstrate substantial creativity
      and need not be in written form. Theses for all other degrees
      SHOULD demonstrate substantial research or analysis. J.N.  and
      D.N.Law are appropriate for high-quality legal analysis, of the
      sort typical to CFJs, but exceeding an ordinary CFJ in depth.  The
      D.N.Hist. degree is appropriate for historical research,
      especially when it presents a narrative that educates Agorans
      about the events of the past. The D.N.Sci. degree is appropriate
      for theses that demonstrate concrete or scientific thinking,
      whereas the D.N.Phil. is appropriate for theses that demonstrate
      abstract or philosophical thinking.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2231/7 (Power=3)
Order of the Hero of Agora Nomic

      Heroic titles are Agora's premier patent titles of distinction,
      and CAN be awarded to persons for meritorious service only by a
      proposal of power 3 or greater, which SHOULD explain why those
      persons are qualified. Bearers of heroic titles (Heroes)

========================================================================
Leaders
   Agora has a good few leaders, most of which are nothing more than
   sinecures. This section isn't all that important.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 103/30 (Power=2)
The Speaker

      The Speaker is an imposed office and the figurehead leader of
      Agora. The player or players who have most recently won the game
      are called Laureled. If at any time the office of Speaker is
      vacant, or when one or more players win Agora, then the Prime
      Minister CAN once appoint a Laureled player to the office of
      Speaker by announcement.
      
      Whenever the Prime Minister CAN appoint a Laureled player to the
      office of Speaker, e SHALL do so in a timely manner, except that
      the Prime Minister MAY defer appointing a new Speaker while there
      is pending one or more open CFJs that could plausibly determine or
      affect the question of whether a player is Laureled.  If the Prime
      Minister is emself Laureled, eir power to appoint a Speaker
      continues for the entirety of a message in which e resigns as
      Prime Minister, and if e is the only Laureled player, e CAN void
      that power, and thereby discharge the obligation to use it, by
      announcing that e declines to take the office.
      
      If the office of Speaker has been held continuously by the same
      person for the past 90+ days, then any player CAN appoint another
      player to the office with support.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 104/0 (Power=3)
First Speaker

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2423/6 (Power=2)
First Among Equals

      The Prime Minister is an office. The Prime Minister is elected by
      the players of Agora primarily on account of not being the other
      person. The Prime Minister SHOULD ensure that Agoran affairs
      proceed smoothly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2463/3 (Power=1)
Motion of No Confidence

      Any player can cause the office of Prime Minister to become vacant
      with Agoran consent by publishing a message with the character
      string "MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE" in the subject line. Motions of
      confidence SHOULD used whenever Agorans want to shake things up,
      rather than as a personal judgement of the Prime Minister.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2451/10 (Power=2)
Executive Orders

      Once per week, except as otherwise forbidden by this rule, the
      current Prime Minister CAN issue a Cabinet Order by announcement
      to perform the action(s) authorized by that Order.
      
      Each Cabinet Order is associated with an office. The current Prime
      Minister CANNOT issue more than one Cabinet Order associated with
      the same office more than once in the same month, nor can e issue
      a Cabinet Order associated with a vacant office.
      
      The available Cabinet Orders are:
      
      - Certiorari (Arbitor): The Prime Minister assigns emself as judge
        of a specified open case.
      
      - Dive (Referee): The Prime Minister levies a fine of 2 on a
        specified player. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the
        reason for the fine MAY be any grievance held by the Prime
        Minister, not necessarily a violation of the rules, against the
        person to whom the fine is levied.
      
      - Manifesto (Promotor): The Prime Minister distributes a specified
        proposal in the Proposal Pool.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2575/3 (Power=3)
The Distributor

      The Distributor is an imposed office whose holder is generally
      responsible for the management of the primary Agoran fora. The
      holder CANNOT be changed except without objection or by proposal.
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the Distributor CANNOT
      deregister or be deregistered.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================
Agoran Culture
   Nothing in here is all that important. Mostly describes holidays and
   tournaments, and joke rules.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2327/3 (Power=1)
Read the Ruleset Week

      The first Agoran week each year which falls entirely in February
      is Read the Ruleset Week. Agorans are encouraged to read the
      ruleset during Read the Ruleset Week.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1727/21 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;
      
      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial Rulesets
      of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets of Nomic
      World and other nomics,
      
      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June 30,
      1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by FIRST SPEAKER
      Michael Norrish, which read, in part,
      
        "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
        precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think we may
        as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules are invited.
        In accordance with the rules, these will be published, numbered
        and distributed by me at my earliest convenience."
      
      And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic,
      known unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was played
      on, until its Players, much later, gave it its OFFICIAL NAME of
      Agora,
      
      And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest, and
      most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the hard work
      and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent advice of
      Agoraphobes,
      
      And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
      founding,
      
      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2464/7 (Power=1)
Tournaments

      A Tournament is a sub-game of Agora specifically sanctioned to be
      initiated as a tournament by the Rules. The person who initiates a
      tournament is its Gamemaster. Each time that one or more winners
      of a tournament are determined before it concludes, that person or
      those persons win the game. A tournament concludes when its
      regulations state that it concludes. Additionally, if it has not
      previously concluded, a tournament concludes 3 months after its
      initiation.
      
      A Tournament is governed by a set of regulations, created in
      accordance with its parent rule, which have binding control over
      those who freely consent to play the tournament and over the
      tournament itself. Once the tournament is concluded, these
      regulations cease to have any effect, and CAN be repealed by any
      player by announcement. A Tournament's regulations collectively
      have Mint Authority.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2566/2 (Power=1)
Free Tournaments

      A player who is not the gamemaster of an existing tournament CAN
      initiate a sanctioned tournament with a specified set of
      regulations with 2 Agoran consent. A tournament created using this
      method is called a Free Tournament.
      
      A free tournament CAN be concluded with no winner without 3
      objections. Tournaments SHOULD only be concluded in this manner if
      it is clear that its regulations are malformed or contrary to the
      tournament's intent or that it is IMPOSSIBLE for any player to win
      the tournament.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 2495/3 (Power=1)
The Birthday Tournament

      In a timely fashion after the start of June 1 of each year, the
      Herald SHALL propose a set of Regulations governing a Birthday
      Tournament for that year; the Herald CAN also delegate the
      responsibility for creating or running the tournament to another
      player, with that player's consent, by announcement.
      
      The Birthday Tournament's regulations SHOULD be such that all
      persons who choose to participate have a fair chance of winning
      the tournament (according to its regulations), and a winner
      SHOULD be expected within 2-3 weeks following the tournament's
      initiation.
      
      After adequate time for discussion of the Birthday Tournament's
      regulations, the Herald (or delegate) CAN initiate a sanctioned
      tournament, promulgating a specified, finalized set of tournament
      regulations, without 3 objections. These regulations may
      thereafter be amended only by the Herald or eir designee Without 3
      Objections. The initiation SHOULD be timed to coincide with
      Agora's Birthday.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1769/15 (Power=3)
Holidays

      The period each year from midnight GMT on the morning of 24
      December to the beginning of the first Agoran week to begin after
      2 January is a Holiday.
      
      The week that contains the beginning of Agora's Birthday,
      together with the following week, is a Holiday.
      
      If a person breaks a Rule by missing a deadline that occurs during
      a Holiday, punishment is generally not appropriate.
