    <h1 id="the-agoran-rulesets">The Agoran Rulesets</h1>

<p>Welcome. If you are trying to access the ruleset of Agora Nomic, you’ve
come to the right place. This website is maintained by Trigon, the
current Rulekeepor of Agora Nomic.</p>

<h2 id="textual-rulesets">Textual Rulesets</h2>

<p>There are two flavors of Agoran Ruleset: The Short Logical Ruleset (SLR)
and the Full Logical Ruleset (FLR).</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="slr.txt">The Short Logical Ruleset</a> contains the full text of all
currently enacted rules, organized into categories. If you are new to
Agora, this is the most accessible version. A new version comes out
every week, and these are date-stamped within the report.</li>
  <li><a href="flr-fresh.txt">The Full Logical Ruleset</a> contains the same rules as
the SLR in the same order, along with a list of changes that rule has
gone through as well as some other notable historical annotations.
<strong>Note that the file linked above is usually going to be unofficial
and updated to include the most recent changes. Officially, the FLR is
only published monthly. That version can be found <a href="flr.txt">here</a>.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ruleset-changelogs"><a href="changelogs">Ruleset Changelogs</a></h2>

<p>I keep a log of every rule change, partially to help me check and
re-check my work, but also for the benefit of the Agoran public and
future Agoran historians.</p>

<h2 id="ruleset-format-updates"><a href="updates">Ruleset Format Updates</a></h2>

<p>I make occasional changes to how the ruleset is formatted. This page
contains a list of each and every one.</p>

<h2 id="other-projects">Other projects</h2>

<p>Additionally, others have made software to track the ruleset. Here’s a
list of links to those projects. <strong>Warning: These all navigate
off-site.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://agora-ruleset.gaelan.me">Gaelan’s ruleset viewer</a> displays
the SLR in HTML format with a table of contents. This website is
generated from current ruleset data like the textual rulesets linked
above. This project is open-source. Its source code can be found
<a href="https://github.com/AgoraNomic/ruleset-viewer">here</a>.</li>
