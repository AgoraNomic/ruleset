    <h1 id="ruleset-format-updates">Ruleset Format Updates</h1>

<p>I make quite regular revisions to how the ruleset is formatted.
Sometimes this is to make the ruleset more functional, sometimes it is
to make it prettier, and sometimes it is to cause it to adhere more
closely to the rules.</p>

<p>As much as Iâ€™d like to add a description of these changes and why I made
them, I am strongly discouraged from doing so in the SLR by Rule 1681/21
for the sake of brevity, and I have no desire to increase the length of
the FLR by any amount.</p>

<p>And so I have resolved to publish a list here on agoranomic.com.</p>
