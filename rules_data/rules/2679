  Banned is a secured negative boolean person switch tracked by the
  Registrar. A person is unwelcome if e is Banned or if at least one
  part of em is unwelcome. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, an
  unwelcome person CANNOT register or be registered, and e is
  immediately deregistered if e is ever a player. Designations of
  unwelcomeness are secured.

  A Banned switch SHOULD ONLY be flipped by a proposal for the
  express purpose of flipping Banned switches.

  Flipping a Banned switch to True (banning a player) SHOULD ONLY be
  done when:

  * the person's actions have been deemed harmful to Agora, to any
    player of Agora, or the overall community, and

  * the harm has been clearly communicated to the person, and e has
    been given time to consider and respond, and

  * e has made no attempt to make amends, eir attempt was
    unsatisfactory, or e has continued to act in harmful ways.

  Actions that are harmful are subject to the discretion of the
  community of Agora, but may include: any form of identity-based
  discrimination, personal attacks, disrespect of values or beliefs
  of any member of the Agoran community, or provocative/bad-faith
  comments.

  Once a quarter, any unwelcome player may submit a Request for
  Forgiveness to the Registrar. Such a document SHOULD contain
  sincere self-reflection including any appropriate apologies and an
  indication on how e intends to avoid or prevent similar incidents
  in the future.

  The Registrar SHALL publish any Request for Forgiveness e receives
  in a timely manner. If the community deems the Request sincere and
  appropriately reconciliatory, steps should be undertaken to flip
  the submitter's Banned switch to False.
