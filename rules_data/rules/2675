  The Dreamor is an office; its holder is responsible for keeping
  track of the dreams of all active players.

  Mindset is a secured active player switch, tracked by the Dreamor
  in eir monthly report, with possible values Dream of Wandering
  (the default) and any Dream.

  An active player CAN Plan to Flip eir own Mindset, specifying any
  valid value for eir Mindset, by announcement.  When the rules
  state that the wandering occurs, every active player's Mindset is
  set to the value e most recently specified by Planning to Flip. If
  a player did not Plan to Flip eir Mindset switch since the last
  wandering, it not Flipped.

  The wandering occurs at the beginning of each month.

  At any time, each active player is either a Sleeping Dreamer
  (Default), a New Dreamer, or a Recurring Dreamer. The state of
  each player is included in the Dreamor's monthly report, which
  SHALL be published in a timely fashion from the beginning of the
  month.

  occurs, e becomes a New Dreamer; otherwise, e becomes a Recurring
  dreamer.
