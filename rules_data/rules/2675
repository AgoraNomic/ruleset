  The Dream Keeper is an office; its holder is responsible for
  keeping track of the dreams of all active players.

  Dream is a secured active player switch, tracked by the Dream
  Keeper in eir weekly report, with possible values any Dream,
  defaulting to Wandering. An "X Dreamer" is a player with eir Dream
  switch set to X.

  An active player CAN "envision" eir own Dream, specifying any
  valid value for eir Dream, by announcement. When the rules state
  that the wandering occurs, every active player's Dream is set to
  the value e most recently envisioned. If a player did not envision
  a dream since the last wandering, it is not flipped.

  A wandering occurs at the beginning of each week.

  The following is an exhaustive list of all Dreams and the rules
  relevant to each dream:

  - Wandering: This dream has no effect.

  - Charity: A Charity Stamp is a stamp of the type that the L&FD
    owns the most of (if there is a tie, the first the L&FD owned,
    and if still tied, the first alphabetically). Immediately after
    a wandering, for each Charity Dreamer, in reverse order of when
    eir Dream was last flipped (and in reverse order of registration
    if tied), one Charity Stamp is transferred from the L&FD to em.
    If the number of Stamps the L&FD owned during the last wandering
    is greater than 10, this process happens a second time. If it is
    more than 20, this process happens a third time.

  - Justice: Immediately after a wandering, 1 blot is expunged from
    each Justice Dreamer. If a Justice Dreamer had no blots
    immediately after a wandering, e CAN onceexpunge one blot, by
    announcement, from a specified player before the next wandering.

  - Sharing: Immediately after a wandering, each Sharing Dreamer has
    eir points increased by X / Y, rounded down, where X is half the
    number of active players, rounded up, and Y is the number of
    Sharing Dreamers.

  - Wealth: Immediately after a wandering, X stamps of eir own type
    are granted to each Wealth Dreamer. When less than 8 Stamps of
    eir type exist, X is 2. When 8 to 15 Stamps of eir type exist, X
    is 1. When 16 ore more Stamps of eir type exist, X is 0.

  - Machinery: A Machinery Dreamer CAN Flip the Device with Agoran
    Consent. A Machinery Dreamer CAN take a specified action on
    behalf of the the device with 1 support.

  - Gardens: Immediately after a wandering, the Base Rockiness of
    each Gardens Dreamer is increased by 1.

  - Power: Each Power Dreamer has eir voting strength increased by 2
    for referenda on ordinary proposals.

  - Revolution: A revolution is happening if the majority of active
    players are Revolution Dreamers. Immediately after a wandering,
    if a revolution is not happening, then all Revolution Dreamers
    have eir radiance decreased by 1 to a minimum of 0. Immediately
    after a wandering, if a revolution is happening, then all
    players have eir radiance set to 100-X, where X was eir radiance
    when the wandering occured, and all player's Dreams are set to
    Wandering.
