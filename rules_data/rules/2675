  The Dream Keeper is an office; its holder is responsible for
  keeping track of the dreams of all active players.

  Dream is a secured active player switch, tracked by the Dream
  Keeper in eir weekly report, with possible values any Dream,
  defaulting to Wandering. An "X Dreamer" is a player with eir Dream
  switch set to X.

  An active player CAN "envision" eir own Dream, specifying any
  valid value for eir Dream, by announcement. When the rules state
  that the wandering occurs, every active player's Dream is set to
  the value e most recently envisioned. If a player did not envision
  a dream since the last wandering, it is not flipped.

  A wandering occurs at the beginning of each week.

  The following is an exhaustive list of all Dreams and the rules
  relevant to each dream:

  - Wandering: This dream has no effect.

  - Charity: Immediately after a wandering, one stamp (chosen by
    most-to-least owned by the L&FD at time of transfer, tie-broken
    alphabetically) is transferred to each Charity Dreamer (in order
    from least-to-most stamps owned, tie-broken alphabetically) from
    the L&FD. If the number of Stamps the L&FD owned during the last
    wandering is greater than 10, this process happens a second
    time. If it is more than 20, this process happens a third time.

  - Justice: Immediately after a wandering, 1 blot is expunged from
    each Justice Dreamer. If a Justice Dreamer had no blots
    immediately after a wandering, e CAN once expunge one blot, by
    announcement, from a specified player before the next wandering.

  - Sharing: Immediately after a wandering, each Sharing Dreamer has
    eir Radiance increased by X / Y, rounded down, where X is half
    the number of active players, rounded up, and Y is the number of
    Sharing Dreamers.

  - Wealth: Immediately after a wandering, X stamps of eir own type
    are granted to each Wealth Dreamer. When less than 8 Stamps of
    eir type exist, X is 2. When 8 to 15 Stamps of eir type exist, X
    is 1. When 16 ore more Stamps of eir type exist, X is 0.

  - Gardens: Immediately after a wandering, the Base Rockiness of
    each Gardens Dreamer is increased by 1.

  - Power: Each Power Dreamer has eir voting strength increased by 2
    for referenda on ordinary proposals.

  - Revolution: A revolution is happening if the majority of active
    players are Revolution Dreamers. Immediately after a wandering,
    if a revolution is not happening, then all Revolution Dreamers
    have eir radiance decreased by 1 to a minimum of 0. Immediately
    after a wandering, if a revolution is happening, then all
    players have eir radiance set to 100-X, where X was eir radiance
    when the wandering occurred, and all player's Dreams are set to
    Wandering.
