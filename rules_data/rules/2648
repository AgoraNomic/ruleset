  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the proposal which enacted
  this rule CAN make multiple rule changes, which it could otherwise
  make individually, simultaneously. When it attempts to do so, if
  any single rule change it attempts is INEFFECTIVE, then so is the
  entire attempt.

  If the proposal which enacted this rule makes a change to the
  definition of a rule then, except for rules which are
  simultaneously and explicitly enacted or repealed with that
  change, the rules after that change are exactly the entities that
  were rules beforehand. This is a definition of the interpretation
  of the amendment to the rules and not, in and of itself, a rule
  change.
