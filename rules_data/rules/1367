  Certain patent titles are known as degrees. The degrees are

  - Associate of Nomic Artistry        (A.N.A.)
  - Associate of Nomic                 (A.N.)
  - Juris Doctorate of Nomic           (J.N.)
  - Baccalaureate of Nomic Artistry    (B.N.A.)
  - Baccalaureate of Nomic             (B.N.)
  - Magisteriate of Nomic Artistry     (M.N.A.)
  - Magisteriate of Nomic              (M.N.)
  - Doctorate of Nomic Artistry        (D.N.Art.)
  - Doctorate of Nomic History         (D.N.Hist.)
  - Doctorate of Nomic Law             (D.N.Law.)
  - Doctorate of Nomic Science         (D.N.Sci.)
  - Doctorate of Nomic Philosophy      (D.N.Phil.)

  There are four classes of degrees, ranked in ascending order of
  merit: Associate degrees (A.N.A. and A.N.), Baccalaureate degrees
  (J.N through B.N.), Magisteriate degrees (M.N.A and M.N), and
  Doctorate degrees (D.N.Art. through D.N.Phil.).

  A specified degree CAN be awarded by any player other than the
  awardee, with 2 Agoran consent. It SHOULD only be awarded for the
  publication of an original thesis of scholarly worth (including
  responses to peer-review), published with explicit intent to
  qualify for a degree. The Herald SHOULD coordinate the peer-review
  process and the awarding of degrees.

  Degrees SHOULD be awarded according to the extent to which the
  thesis contributes to Nomic culture or thought: Associate degrees
  for an appreciable contribution, Baccalaureate degrees for a
  substantial contribution, Magisteriate degrees for a remarkable
  contribution, and Doctorate degrees for an exceptional
  contribution. Any degree at the Doctorate level SHOULD take into
  account the awardee's academic history and participation in Agora
  over time.

  Theses for Artistry degrees SHOULD demonstrate substantial
  creativity and need not be in written form. Theses for all other
  degrees SHOULD demonstrate substantial research or analysis. J.N.
  and D.N.Law are appropriate for high-quality legal analysis, of
  the sort typical to CFJs, but exceeding an ordinary CFJ in depth.
  The D.N.Hist. degree is appropriate for historical research,
  especially when it presents a narrative that educates Agorans
  about the events of the past. The D.N.Sci. degree is appropriate
  for theses that demonstrate concrete or scientific thinking,
  whereas the D.N.Phil. is appropriate for theses that demonstrate
  abstract or philosophical thinking.
