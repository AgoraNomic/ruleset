  Creating and destroying types of Crop is secured.

  Each type of Crop has an associated Crop Season, Seed Cost, Growth
  Duration, and Sell Price. Actions involving any of these
  attributes use the attribute values for the type of Crop involved
  in that action.

  An in-season Crop is one whose Crop Season is in progress. All
  others are out-of-season.
