  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the proposal which enacted this
  rule CAN effect multiple rule changes, which it could otherwise effect
  individually, simultaneously. When it
  attempts to do so, if any single rule change it attempts is
  INEFFECTIVE, then so is the entire attempt.

  If the proposal which enacted this rule effects a change to the
  definition of a rule then, except for rules which are simultaneously
  and explicitly enacted or repealed with that change, as appropriate,
  the rules after that change are exactly the entities that were rules
  beforehand. This is a definition of the interpretation of the
  amendment to the rules and not, in and of itself, a rule change.
