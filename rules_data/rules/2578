  A fungible asset (syn. "currency") is an asset where two instances
  of it are considered equivalent if they have the same owner, for
  the purposes of specification, granting, and transferring. The
  total amount of a fungible asset that an entity owns is also know
  as that entity's "balance" of that asset.
