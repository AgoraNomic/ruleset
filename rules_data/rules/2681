  A Fingerprint for a document (the Plaintext) is a document that
  could not have been reasonably created without knowledge of the
  Plaintext, and which is related to the Plaintext in such a way
  that one could not reasonably produce another document related to
  that Fingerprint in the same way.

  Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
  commitment" to a particular kind of document, that person performs
  that action by performing it by announcement while, in the same
  message, also publishing a what is purportedly a Fingerprint for a
  document of that kind.
