  A Fingerprint for a document (the Plaintext) is a document that
  could not have been reasonably created without knowledge of the
  Plaintext, and which is related to the Plaintext in such a way
  that one could not reasonably produce another document related to
  that Fingerprint in the same way.

  A person CAN make a commitment to a particular kind of document by
  publishing a statement that purports to be a Fingerprint for a
  document of that kind. If the statement is in fact such a
  Fingerprint, the person CAN then reveal the commitment by
  publishing the Plaintext corresponding to that Fingerprint and
  clearly indicating which Fingerprint the Plaintext relates to.

  A person making a commitment SHOULD specify the method used to
  produce the Fingerprint from the Plaintext.
