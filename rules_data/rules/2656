  A player's Score, indicated in Points, is an integer player switch
  defaulting to 0, tracked by the Herald.

  Upon a correct announcement from a player that one or more players
  have a score of 100+ points, all players meeting this condition
  win the game.  If a least one player wins the game via such an
  announcement, the scores of the winning players are set to their
  default, and then all other players' scores are set to half their
  current value rounded down.

  The Herald CAN once each, by announcement, grant 15, 10, and 5
  boatloads of coins to the players who had the most, second most,
  and third most points (respectively) at the end of the previous
  quarter. E SHALL do so in a timely manner after the beginning of
  the quarter.

  At the start of every quarter, all Scores are set to half their
  current value rounded down.
