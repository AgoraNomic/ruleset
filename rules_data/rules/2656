  A player's Score, indicated in Points, is an integer player switch
  defaulting to 0, tracked by the Herald.

  A player with 100 or more points CAN declare a High Score by

  player incorrectly does so, e loses 5 points. Upon a correct
  declaration of High Score, that player wins the game. Then, eir
  score is set to 0, and all other players' scores are set to half
  their current value rounded down.

  At the start of every quarter, all Scores are set to half their
  current value rounded down.
