  A player's Score, indicated in Points, is an integer player switch
  defaulting to 0, tracked by the Herald.

  Upon a correct announcement from a player that one or more players
  have a score of 100+ points, all players meeting this condition
  win the game.  If a least one player wins the game via such an
  announcement, all players' scores are set to their default.


  The Herald CAN once each, by announcement, grant 15, 10, and 5
  boatloads of coins to the players who had the most, second most,
  and third most points (respectively) at the end of the previous
  quarter. E SHALL do so in a timely manner after the beginning of
  the quarter.

  At the start of every quarter, all Scores are set to half their
  current value rounded down.
