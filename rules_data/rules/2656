  A player's Score, indicated in Points, is an integer player switch
  defaulting to 0, tracked by the Herald.

  Upon a correct announcement from a player that one or more players
  have a score of 100+ points, all players meeting this condition
  win the game.  If a least one player wins the game via such an
  announcement, all players' scores are set to their default.
