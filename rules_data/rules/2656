  The Illuminator is an office, responsible for tracking radiance.

  A player's Radiance is an integer player switch defaulting to 0,
  tracked by the Illuminator. When a player is "granted" or "gains"
  a specified amount of radiance, eir radiance is increased by that
  amount.

  Upon a correct announcement from a player that eir radiance is 100
  or more (correctly specifying the amount), e Outshines the Sun.

  When a player Outshines the Sun, e wins the game. When a player
  wins the game this way, the following happen in order:

  * Eir radiance is set to 0.

  * The radiance of each other player is set to half its current
    value (rounded down).

  Once per quarter, the Illuminator CAN by announcement (and SHALL
  during its first Eastman week) issue a Notice of Diminution, upon
  which all radiance switches are set to half their current value
  rounded down.

  Any player CAN increase eir radiance by 1 by paying a fee of 2
  Spendies.
