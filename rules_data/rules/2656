  A player's Radiance is an integer player switch defaulting to 0,
  tracked by the Herald. When a player is "granted" or "gains" a
  specified amount of radiance, eir radiance is increased by that
  amount.

  Upon a correct announcement from a player that eir radiance is 100
  or more (correctly specifying the amount), e wins the game. Then,
  eir radiance is set to 0, and all other players' radiance are set
  to half their current value rounded down.

  At the start of every quarter, all radiance switches are set to
  half their current value rounded down.
