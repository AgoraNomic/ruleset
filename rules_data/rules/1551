  When a document or statement (hereafter "document") is ratified,
  rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the gamestate is modified
  to what it would be if, at the time the ratified document was
  published, the gamestate had been minimally modified to make the
  ratified document as true and accurate as possible; however, if
  the document explicitly specifies a different past time as being
  the time the document was true, the specified time is used to
  determine the minimal modifications. Such a modification cannot
  add inconsistencies between the gamestate and the rules, and it
  cannot include rule changes unless the ratified document
  explicitly and unambiguously recites either the changes or the
  resulting properties of the rule(s). If no such modification is
  possible, or multiple substantially distinct possible
  modifications would be equally appropriate, the ratification
  fails.

  An internally inconsistent document generally cannot be ratified;
  however, if such a document can be divided into a summary section
  and a main section, where the only purpose of the summary section
  is to summarize information in the main section, and the main
  section is internally consistent, ratification of the document
  proceeds as if it contained only the main section.

  Text purportedly about previous instances of ratification (e.g. a
  report's date of last ratification) is excluded from ratification.
  The rules may define additional information that is considered to
  be part of the document for the purposes of ratification; such
  definitions are secured at a Power Threshold of 3.

  Ratification is secured with Power Threshold 3.
