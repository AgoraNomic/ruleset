  In a conflict between Rules, the conflict shall be resolved by
  performing the following comparisons in the sequence written in
  this rule, until the conflict is resolved.

  - In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
    the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
    Power; otherwise,

  - If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
    precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
    determining precedence relations, then the determinations of the
    precedence-determining Rule shall be used to resolve the
    conflicts; otherwise,

  - If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
    itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or takes
    precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
    provisions shall be used to resolve the conflict, unless they
    lead to contradictions between each other; otherwise,

  - If any of the rules in conflict have ID numbers, then the Rule
    with the lowest ID number takes precedence; otherwise,

  - The Rule enacted earliest takes precedence.

  Clauses in any other rule that broadly claim precedence (e.g. over
  "all rules" of a certain class) shall be, prima facie, considered
  to be limited claims of precedence or deference that are
  applicable only when such claims are evaluated as described within
  the above sequence.

  No change to the ruleset can occur that would cause a Rule to
  directly claim precedence over this Rule as a means of determining
  precedence. This applies to changes by the enactment or amendment
  of a Rule, or of any other form. This Rule takes precedence over
  any Rule that would permit such a change to the ruleset.

    The presence in a Rule of deference clause, claiming that the
    Rule defers to another Rule, does not prevent a conflict with
    the other Rule arising, but shows only how the Rule says that
    conflict is to be resolved when it does arise.

    This Rule is to be applied to resolve Rule conflicts on a
    case-by-case basis; just because a Rule is inapplicable in one
    situation due to conflict with a Rule of higher precedence does
    not mean that the Rule is nullified in all cases.

    If a situation can be arranged where a rule claims precedence
    over the rule defining precedence relations (currently R1030),
    the rules are inconsistent and the rule governing rule
    interpretation (currently R217) resolves the conflict.
