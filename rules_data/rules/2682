  The Ricemastor is an office, in charge of tracking Rice, Rice
  Plans and Signatures. Rice is a fixed asset, ownable only by
  players. Any active player can create a Rice Plan by announcement,
  if e hasn't done so yet in the current week. Rice Plans can have
  Signatures, and each Signature must be of an active player. A Rice
  Plan has an active player's Signature as long as that player is
  consenting to it. An active player can destroy a Rice Plan that e
  has created by announcement.

  A Harvest occurs at the beginning of each week. When this occurs:
  - If there is only one Rice Plan with the most Signatures, that
    Rice Plan is Harvested.
  - If there is more than one Rice Plan with the most Signatures,
    the one that was created earliest is Harvested.
  - In all other cases, nothing happens.
  And then all Rice Plans are destroyed and the Harvest ends.

  Rice Plans consist of two lists of players, with each list having
  no repeated players, and the lists can be empty. One of these
  lists is its Rice Up list, and the other is its Rice Down list.
  When a Rice Plan is Harvested, for each player listed in its Rice
  Up list, if that player is active, e gains 1 Rice; and for each
  player listed in its Rice Down list, if e has at least 1 Rice then
  e lose 1 Rice.

  If after a Harvest there is a single active player with at least 2
  Rice and more Rice than any other player, then that player wins
  the game, and all Rice is destroyed. When the game has been won in
  this manner three times, this rule repeals itself.
