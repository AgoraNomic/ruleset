  The Ricemastor is an office.

  Rice is a fixed asset tracked by the Ricemastor, with ownership
  wholly restricted to players. If a rice would otherwise be in
  abeyance or is owned by the Lost and Found Department, it is
  destroyed.

  An active player CAN create a rice plan by announcement once per
  week, specifying two sets of players (the rice up set and the rice
  down set).  When a rice plan is harvested, each active player in
  the rice up set gains one rice, then one rice is revoked from each
  player in the rice down set (if e has any). The Ricemastor's
  weekly report includes a list of rice plans. The creator of a rice
  plan CAN by announcement destroy it, thereby causing it to cease
  to be a rice plan.

  An active player CAN by announcement sign a specified rice plan.
  An active player's signature is on a rice plan if e has signed it
  or if a contract e is party to clearly and unambiguously states
  that eir signature is on it. The Ricemastor's weekly report
  includes, for each rice plan, a list of players with signatures on
  it.

  A harvest occurs at the beginning of each week. When a harvest
  occurs, the following happen in order:
  * The rice plan with the most signatures (breaking ties in favor
    of the earliest created), if any, is harvested.
  * All rice plans are destroyed.

  Immediately after a harvest, if a single active player has at
  least 5 rice and more rice than any other player, e wins the game,
  then all rice and rice plans are destroyed. If the game has been
  won in this manner three times, this rule immediately repeals
  itself.
