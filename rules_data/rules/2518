  If a value CANNOT be reasonably determined (without circularity or
  paradox) from information reasonably available, or if it
  alternates indefinitely between values, then the value is
  considered to be indeterminate, otherwise it is determinate.

  A communication purporting to express conditional intent to
  perform an action is considered unclear and ambiguous unless, at a
  minimum, the conditional is determinate, true, and reasonably
  straightforward to evaluate with publicly-available information at
  the time of communication. The communicator SHOULD explain
  specific reasons for being uncertain of the outcome when e makes
  the communication.
