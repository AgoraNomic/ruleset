  and a default of 10. Stone Cost is tracked by the Stonemason.

  Any player CAN pay a fee of X Spendies to transfer a specified
  non-immune stone to emself, where X is the current Stone Cost of the
  specified stone.

  At the beginning of each week, for each stone that was not
  transferred during the previous week, its Stone Cost is reduced by 1, 
  to a minimum of 1. Then, for each stone that was transferred more than 
  once during the previous week, its Stone Cost is increased by 1.
