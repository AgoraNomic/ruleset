  Base Rockiness is an active player switch, with values of integers
  and default of 0, tracked by the Stonemason. A player's Modified
  Rockiness is eir Base Rockiness minus the number of stones e owns.

  Once a week each player CAN "reach" for a specified stone owned by
  Agora by announcement.

  At the beginning of each week, each stone owned by Agora is
  transferred to the player (if any) with the highest Modified
  Rockiness that reached for that stone in the previous week, with
  ties broken in favor of the tied player who reached for that stone
  first. When a player receives a stone in this way, eir Base
  Rockiness is set to 0.
