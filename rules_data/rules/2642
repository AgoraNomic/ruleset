  Base Rockiness is an active player switch, with values of integers
  and default of 0, tracked by the Stonemason. A player's Modified
  Rockiness is eir Base Rockiness minus the number of stones e owns.

  Once a week each player CAN "reach" for a specified stone owned by
  Agora by announcement.

  At the beginning of each week, the stone specified by the player
  with the highest Modified Rockiness that reached for a stone in
  the previous week is transferred to em. In a tie, the stone
  specified by the tied player who reached first is transferred to
  em. When a player receives a stone in this way, eir Base Rockiness
  is set to 0.
