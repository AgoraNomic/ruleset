  There exists a document, initially empty, known as the
  Empireworld, which should describe in some way a fictional world.
  Each player that has amended this document is said to have their
  own Empire in the Empireworld, and such players are Imperials.

  A player CAN amend the Empireworld once per week by announcement
  to narratively progress the Empireworld in some reasonable
  fashion. The message with this kind of announcement MUST include
  the latest form of the Empireworld post-amendment. These
  amendments MUST follow relevant guidance given in CFJs. Imperials
  are ENCOURAGED to shape this subgame through CFJs.

  Any person can amend the Empireworld without 2 objections and
  Imperials are ENCOURAGED to attempt this action when they believe
  it to be appropriate.

  An Imperial CAN, without 2 objections, Dominate the World provided
  that (1) the Empireworld shows that e has accomplished at least 3
  extraordinary feats in the fictional world that the Empireworld
  describes since e last won the game as a result of this Rule and
  that (2) no person has won the game as a result of this Rule in
  the past 30 days. When a player Dominates the World, e wins the
  game.

  This Rule does not describe what qualifies as an extraordinary
  feat.
