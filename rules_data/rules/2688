  There exists a document known as the Empireworld, which should
  describe in some way a fictional world. Each player that has
  amended this document is said to have their own Empire in the
  Empireworld, and such players are Imperials.

  A player CAN amend the Empireworld once per week by announcement
  to narratively progress the Empireworld in some reasonable
  fashion. The message with this kind of announcement MUST include
  the latest form of the Empireworld post-amendment. These
  amendments MUST follow relevant guidance given in CfJs. Imperials
  are ENCOURAGED to shape this subgame through CfJs.

  Any person can amend the Empireworld without 2 objections and
  Imperials are ENCOURAGED to attempt this action when ey believe it
  to be appropriate.

  An Imperial can, by announcement, win the game without 2
  objections if the Empireworld shows that ey have accomplished at
  least 3 extraordinary feats in the fictional world that the
  Empireworld describes since ey last won the game in this way. This
  rule does not describe what qualifies as an extraordinary feat.
