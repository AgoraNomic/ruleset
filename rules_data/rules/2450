  If a consenting Player makes a clear public pledge (syn. Oath) to
  perform (or refrain from performing) certain actions, then
  breaking the pledge is ILLEGAL; doing so is the Class N infraction
  of Oathbreaking, where N is the value explicitly stated by the
  pledge, or 2 if the pledge does not explicitly state a value.
  Allowing a pledge to expire without carrying out an action one
  pledged to do in it constitutes breaking the pledge.

  The time window of a pledge is W days, where W is the value
  explicitly stated by the pledge, or 60 if the pledge does not
  explicitly state a value. A pledge ceases to exist at the end of
  its time window.

  If breaking the pledge harms specific other parties, the Referee
  SHOULD solicit the opinion of those parties in determining an
  appropriate fine.

  The Notary CAN destroy a pledge Without Objection, but SHOULD NOT
  do so unless the pledge no longer serves any significant purpose.
