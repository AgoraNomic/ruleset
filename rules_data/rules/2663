  A player CAN buy bird food by paying a fee of 3 boatloads of
  coins.

  A player CAN release a specified bird e owns, by announcement.
  When a bird is released, it is transferred to Agora.

  Once per month, a Beast Permitted Player CAN transfer a specified
  bird owned by Agora to emself by announcement.

  Once per month, the Avicultor CAN publish a migration notice by
  announcement, specifying all necessary information and choices;
  this constitutes eir monthly report. The Avicultor SHALL publish
  such a notice in a timely fashion after the beginning of each
  Agoran month.

  The number of times each player bought bird food in the previous
  month is included in the migration notice.

  A bird not owned by the player(s) who bought bird food the most
  times during the previous month is a Hungry Bird.

  For each Hungry Bird, a random choice among all players who bought
  bird food during the previous month is included alongside that
  bird in the migration notice.

  When a migration notice is published, Hungry Birds are transferred
  to their corresponding randomly chosen players in an order
  specified by the migration notice.

  If a bird being transferred to a player would cause that player to
  have more birds than the number of times e bought bird food during
  the previous month, that bird is instead transferred to Agora.
