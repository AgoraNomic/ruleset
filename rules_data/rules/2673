  Any player CAN, by announcement if no player has done so yet this
  week, motivate the horses, specifying a random horse (the
  galloper) and a random number choice of 1, 2, or 3. When movement
  resolves, the galloper's Race Position is increased by 1 a number
  of times equal to the random number choice, and then each of the
  galloper's pulls have their Race Position increased by 1 in
  alphabetical order of their names.

  The horsened SHALL NOT let a week go by without the horses having
  been motivated.

  Each horse has an associated non-repeating set of horses, their
  "pulls", tracked by the Horsened.

  When the race begins anew, the horse's pulls are set to the
  following:
