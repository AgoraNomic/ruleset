  Any player CAN, by announcement if no player has done so yet this
  week, motivate the horses, specifying a random horse (the
  galloper) and a random number choice of 1, 2, or 3. When movement
  resolves, the galloper's Race Position is increased by the random
  number choice, and then each of the galloper's pulls have their
  Race Position increased by 1 in alphabetical order of their names.

  The horsened SHALL NOT let a week go by without the horses having
  been motivated.

  Pulls (syn. pull) is a Horse switch, tracked by the Horsened. It
  has possible values of any set of horses.

  When the race begins anew, the horse's pulls are set to the
  following:
