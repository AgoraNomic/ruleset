  Activity is a player switch tracked by the Registrar, with values
  Active (default) and Inactive.  To flip a player's activity to
  active (inactive) is to activate (deactivate) em.  The date on
  which each player's activity was last changed is part of the
  Registrar's weekly report.

  A player CAN activate or deactivate emself by announcement.

  Any player CAN, with notice, make a player who has not made a
  public announcement in the past 30 days inactive.

  If a player has been inactive continuously for the past 60 days,
  then any player CAN deregister em without 3 objections. The
  Registrar SHOULD attempt to deregister players who meet this
  condition. The publication of intent for such a deregistration
  SHOULD be sent to the inactive player's registered email address
  at the same time that it is published.
