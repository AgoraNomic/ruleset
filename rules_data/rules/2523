  The text of a contract can specify obligations upon its parties.
  Parties to a contract SHALL abide by its terms, breaching them
  neither negligently nor deliberately. The fact that the action
  described by the contract is in violation of the rules is not a
  defense if the violative nature is reasonably clear from its text.
  If whether an action is permitted, forbidden, required, or made
  optional by a contract is indeterminate or subject to an
  inextricable conditional, it is presumptively permitted.

  As an exception to the provisions of the previous paragraph and
  the circumstances in which fines would ordinarily be appropriate,
  a person levying a fine under this rule MAY and CAN validly
  consider the equitable interests of justice and interests of the
  game, including the importance of the observation of contracts, as
  a mitigating or aggravating circumstances when levying a fine.
  Such a person MAY, CAN validly, and SHOULD also consider the
  instructions of the contract or contracts in question when levying
  a fine.
