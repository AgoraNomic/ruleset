name: Initiating Agoran Decisions
power: 3

  An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
  initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
  to initiate the decision. To be valid, the notice must clearly
  specify the following information:

  1. The matter to be decided (for example, "the adoption of
     proposal 4781");

  2. The voting method;

  3. A clear description of the valid options;

  4. The identity of the vote collector; and

  5. Any additional information defined by the rules as essential
     parameters.

  The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting period
  for the decision. The default length of the voting period is 7
  days. Changing the length of a decision's voting period is secured
  at power 2, and it CANNOT be set or changed to more than 14 days,
  or less than 5 days for a decision with at least two options.

  The vote collector for a decision with less than two options CAN
  end the voting period by announcement, if it has not ended
  already, and provided that e resolves the decision in the same
  message.

  A public notice purporting to initiate an Agoran decision is a
  self-ratifying attestation that the notice was valid, that the
  person (if any) publishing the notice was authorized to initiate
  the decision, and that such a decision was initiated.
