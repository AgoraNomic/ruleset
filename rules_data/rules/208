  The vote collector for an unresolved Agoran decision CAN resolve
  it by announcement, indicating the outcome. If it was required to
  be initiated, then e SHALL resolve it in a timely fashion after
  the end of the voting period. To be EFFECTIVE, such an attempt
  must satisfy the following conditions:

  1. It is published after the voting period has ended.

  2. It clearly identifies the matter to be resolved.

  3. It specifies the number of voters (or a list of the voters).
     For these purposes and for determining quorum, a "voter" is
     someone who submitted a ballot on the decision that was valid
     when it was submitted and also valid (i.e. not withdrawn or
     otherwise invalidated) at the end of the voting period.

  4. It specifies the outcome, as described elsewhere, and, if there
     was more than one valid option, provides a tally of the voters'
     valid ballots.

  Each Agoran decision has exactly one vote collector, defaulting to
  the initiator of the decision. If the vote collector is defined by
  reference to a position (or, in the default case, if the initiator
  was so defined), then the vote collector is the current holder of
  that position.

  This rule takes precedence over any rule that would provide
  another mechanism by which an Agoran decision may be resolved.

  In general, changes to the gamestate due to the outcome of an
  Agoran decision take effect when the decision is resolved.
