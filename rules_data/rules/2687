  Once per week, each player CAN enter the raffle by paying a fee of
  1 stamp of eir own type to Agora.

  Once each week, the Collector CAN and SHALL publish a Raffle
  Result by announcement, containing a list of players that entered
  the raffle in the previous week (the participants of the raffle)
  and the selection of a random player from that list (the winner of
  the raffle) if it is not empty.

  When a Raffle Result is published, each stamp that was owned by
  Agora at the start of the current week is transferred to the
  winner of the raffle (if there is one), and each participant of
  the raffle gains 1 radiance.
  
  At the end of each week in which a Raffle Result was not published, each
  stamp owned by Agora at the beginning of the week is transferred to the
  player it has as a type, or to the Lost and Found Department if no such
  player exists. Then, each player that received a stamp this way gains 1
  radiance.
