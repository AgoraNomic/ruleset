  An emergency message is one whose subject line contains the text
  "[Emergency]".

  The Prime Minister CAN, in an emergency message and with 3 Agoran
  consent, enact, amend, or repeal Emergency Regulations, provided
  that the intent to do so was also contained in an emergency
  message. To the extent explicitly permitted by this rule,
  Emergency regulations are always taking effect.

  Emergency Regulations CAN, as part of their effect:
    - Extend any deadline provided for by any instrument other than
      this rule, including a deadline for an obligation to be met,
      or deadline prior to which an action must be performed in
      order to be valid, such as the end of voting period. Such an
      extension CANNOT cause the total time period, such as the
      time from when an obligation was created to the deadline or
      the whole of a voting period, to be more than double its
      original length.
    - Create, destroy, or transfer assets, or require or forbid
      their creation, destruction, or transfer.
    - Collectively, exercise Mint Authority
    - Cause one or more players to win Agora.
    - Appoint or remove officeholders, other than Prime Minister or
      Speaker.
    - Modify the Festivity.
    - Award Patent Titles that are either Badges or are not
      mentioned in any Rule.
    - Modify the Publicity of Fora.

  The Prime Minister CAN, in an emergency message and with 4 Agoran
  Consent, provided that the intent to do so was also contained in
  an emergency message, Extend the Emergency.

  If there is an Emergency Regulation that has existed for at least
  a month and the Prime Minister has not Extended the Emergency in
  the past month, any player CAN, with 7 days notice, repeal all
  Emergency Regulations.

  If the Prime Minister has not sent a message to a public forum in
  the preceding four days, the Speaker CAN exercise eir powers under
  this rule as if e were the Prime Minister, and notwithstanding any
  rule that would prohibit a single player from holding both
  offices.

  CANNOT be enacted, amended, or repealed except as described in
