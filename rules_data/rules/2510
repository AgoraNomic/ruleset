  Karma is a person switch tracked by the Herald in eir Weekly
  Report. Karma is an Integer switch. Agora also has an instance of
  the Karma switch.

  A player CAN publish a Notice of Honour. For a Notice of Honour
  to be valid, it must:

  1. Be clear that it is a Notice of Honour, and be the first valid
     Notice of Honour that player has published in the current week;

  2. Specify any other player or Agora to gain karma, and provide a
     reason for specifying that player; and

  3. Specify any player or Agora to lose karma, and provide a reason
     for specifying that player.

  When a valid Notice of Honour is published, the entity specified
  to gain karma has eir karma increased by one, and the entity
  specified to lose karma has eir karma decreased by one. Raising
  one entity's karma while lowering another's in this manner is
  considered to be a "transfer" of karma.

  A player's positions in Court are defined as follows:

  - Any player with a karma of 5 or greater is a Samurai.

  - Any player with a karma of -5 or less is an Gamma.

  - The Samurai with the highest karma (if any) is the Shogun.

  - The Gamma with the lowest karma (if any) is the Honourless
    Worm.

  Each player's positions in Court are part of of the Herald's
  Weekly Report.

  At the beginning of each quarter, the Karma of every person is
  halved (rounding towards 0).
