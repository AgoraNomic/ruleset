  Karma is an Agora and player integer switch tracked by the Herald
  in eir Weekly Report.

  A player CAN publish a Notice of Honour. For a Notice of Honour to
  be valid, it must:

  1. Be clear that it is a Notice of Honour, and be the first valid
     Notice of Honour that player has published in the current week;

  2. Specify any other active player or Agora to gain karma, and
    provide a reason for specifying that player; and

  3. Specify any active player or Agora to lose karma, and provide a
     reason for specifying that player.

  4. Not result in Agora's karma moving farther away from 0.

  When a valid Notice of Honour is published, the entity specified
  to gain karma has eir karma increased by one, and the entity
  specified to lose karma has eir karma decreased by one.

  - The player with the highest karma (if any) is the Paragon.

  - The player with the lowest karma (if any) is the Renegade.

  At the beginning of each quarter, every player's Karma is set to
  half of its current value, rounded towards 0. Agora's Karma is
  then set to zero minus the sum of all player karma values.
