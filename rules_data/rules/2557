  When the rules authorize an investigator to impose the Cold Hand
  of Justice for a violation, e CAN do so by levying a fine of B on
  the perp by announcement, within the following guidelines:

  - B is at least 1 and at most twice the base value of the
    violation.
  
  - If the violation is described by the rules as a "Class N Crime"
    (where N is a positive integer, or an expression that evaluates
    to a positive integer), then N is the base value; otherwise the
    base value is 2.
  
  - The fine SHOULD be reduced to the degree that the violation is a
    minor, accidental, and/or inconsequential infraction.
  
  - The fine SHOULD be increased to the degree that the violation is
    willful, profitable, egregious, or an abuse of an official
    position.
  
  Optionally, in the same message in which e imposes justice, the
  investigator CAN specify that the violation is forgivable,
  specifying up to 10 words to be included in an apology.  If the
  investigator does so, the perp CAN, in a timely fashion, expunge P
  blots from emself, where P is the value of the fine, by publishing
  a formal apology of at least 200 words and including all the
  specified words, explaining eir error, shame, remorse, and ardent
  desire for self-improvement.
