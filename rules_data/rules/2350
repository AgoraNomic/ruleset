  A proposal is a type of entity consisting of a body of text and
  other attributes. A player CAN create (syn. submit) a proposal by
  announcement, specifying its text and optionally specifying any of
  the following attributes:

  * An associated title.

  * A list of coauthors (which must be persons other than the
    author).

  * An adoption index.

  Creating a proposal adds it to the Proposal Pool. Once a proposal
  is created, its text, author, and AI cannot be changed. The author
  (syn. proposer) of a proposal is the person who created it.

  The author of a proposal in the Proposal Pool CAN remove (syn.
  retract, withdraw) it from the Pool by announcement.

  The destruction of a proposal and the causing of a proposal to
  cease being a proposal are secured. The removal of a proposal from
  the Proposal Pool, other than by distribution, is secured.

    Preceding a proposal-like text with the heading "Proposal:" and
    a title can be sufficient to clearly indicate that it is
    intended to become a proposal, but is not if it can be
    interpreted as quoting an existing proposal.

    Preceding a proposal-like text with the question "What is the

    When creating a proposal by announcement, specifying an
    impossible value for an optional attribute makes the creation
    fail.
