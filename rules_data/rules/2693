  The Simplifior is an office; its holder is responsible for
  increasing the readability of the Short Logical Ruleset by making
  a more readable version.

  The Simplifior SHOULD maintain the Readable Logical Ruleset when
  any rules are amended, enacted, or removed.

  The Simplifior's monthly report includes the Readable Logical
  Ruleset.  The Simplifior's report SHOULD prominently and clearly
  include a reminder that the RLR is a summary and only the rules'
  full text actually governs.
