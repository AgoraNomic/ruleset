  The Archivist is an office; its holder is responsible for ensuring
  the continued availability of documents of historical interest.

  The archivistâ€™s monthly report contains:
    * Instructions for accessing collections of:
      * Texts of each historic rule revision.
      * Texts of each proposal.
      * Judicial cases.
      * Public messages.
      * Messages to discussion fora.
      * Theses for which a person was awarded a degree.
      * Optionally, any other documents the Archivist deems worthy
        of archival.
    * A description of the completeness of each of the above
      collections.
  The referenced collections NEED NOT be perfectly complete or
  accurate, but the Archivist SHOULD work towards improving their
  completeness and accuracy.
