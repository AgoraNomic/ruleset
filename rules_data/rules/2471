  A person SHALL NOT make a public statement that is a lie.

  A public statement is falsy if any of the following was true at
  the time of publication:
  * The statement was not true and the author knew or should have
    known that it was not true.
  * The author did not believe the statement to be true.

  A public statement is a lie if it is falsy and any of the
  following is true:
  * The author made the statement with intent to mislead.
  * The author, in the same message, declared the statement to be
    made "under penalty of No Faking" (or similar).

  For the purposes of this rule, an attempt to perform an action by
  publishing certain text constitutes an implicit statement that the
  action was EFFECTIVE.

  Merely quoting a statement or attempt does not constitute making
  it for the purposes of this rule. Any disclaimer, conditional
  clause, or other qualifier attached to a statement or attempt
  constitutes part of the statement or attempt for the purposes of
  this rule; the truth or falsity of the whole is what is
  significant.

  The above notwithstanding, a formal announcement of intent is
  never a lie.
