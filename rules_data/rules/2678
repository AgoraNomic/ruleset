  An "Agoran forum" is a forum with publicity of discussion or
  public. Players of Agora have the following expectations of Agoran
  fora:

  * Agoran fora allow equal participation for all players, subject
    to the rules of Agora and the explicitly stated rules of the
    fora.

  * The rules of participation in public fora are as closely aligned
    with the rules of Agora itself as possible; a player expects to
    be able to fully participate in all public fora as long as eir
    participation is in line with Agora's rules.

  * Agoran fora allow all interested persons, even those that are
    otherwise restricted in eir participation, to read all messages.

  * Discussion fora moderators may restrict participation subject to
    eir own clearly stated rules but should only do so to players
    temporarily and proportional to the harm of the rule breakage.

  * The content of discussion fora should primarily be about Agora
    itself, or reasonably adjacent topics.

  If an existing Agoran forum is in violation of these expectations,
  the Agoran community, led by the Registrar, SHOULD remove it or
  replace it with an appropriate forum as soon as possible.
