  A player acting as emself (the deputy) CAN perform an action
  ordinarily reserved for an office-holder as if e held the office
  if all of the following are true:

   1) The rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of
      holding that office, to perform the action. (This requirement
      is fulfilled by the deputy performing the action.)

   2) It would be POSSIBLE for the deputy to perform the action,
      other than by deputisation, if e held the office.

   3) The deputy, when performing the action, announces that e is
      doing so by deputisation or by temporary deputisation.

   4) The deputy has not held the office in the past 7 days.

  (If the office is vacant, then the remaining items in this list
  need not be true.)

   5) A time limit by which the rules require the action to be
      performed has expired.

   6) The office's holder has not changed in the past 7 days.

   7) Any of the following are true:

      a) The deputy announced between 2 and 14 days earlier that
         e intended to deputise for that office for the purposes of
         the particular action.

      b) The time limit expired between 14 and 28 days ago.

      c) The time limit expired more than 28 days ago, and the
         deputisation is temporary.

  When a player deputises for an elected office, e becomes the
  holder of that office, unless the deputisation is temporary, doing
  so would make em Overpowered, and/or the action being performed
  would already install someone into that office.

    A requirement to perform an action, for the purposes of this
    rule, can be a logical implication from rules and circumstances,
    not just directly imposed by the rules. In particular, it is
    possible to deputise to rotate the bench.

    Deputisation is generally treated as if the deputy gained the
    office immediately before the action, and lost it immediately
    after.

    To perform an action by temporary deputisation is to deputise.
