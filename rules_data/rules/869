  Any entity (including a group of confederated entities) that is or
  ever was able to willingly communicate original ideas is a person.
  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no other entities are
  persons.

  Questions about personhood are to be resolved equitably, with
  regard for the good-faith of those involved and the customs of
  honorable play.

  Citizenship is a secured person switch with values Unregistered
  (default) and Registered, tracked by the Registrar. A registered
  person is a Player. To "register" someone is to flip that person's
  Citizenship switch from Unregistered to Registered.

  An Unregistered person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or
  prevented by the rules) register by publishing a message that
  indicates reasonably clearly and reasonably unambiguously that e
  intends to become a player at that time. No person can be a player
  if e is part of another player or another player is part of em.

  A player, acting as emself, CAN deregister (cease being a player)
  by announcement. If e does so, e CANNOT register or be registered
  for 30 days.

  A person, by registering, agrees to abide by the Rules. The Rules
  CANNOT otherwise bind a person to abide by any agreement without
  that person's willful consent.

  The Rules CANNOT compel non-players to act without their express
  or reasonably implied consent. The rules CANNOT compel players to
  unduly harass non-players. A non-person CANNOT be a player, rules
  to the contrary notwithstanding.

  Banned is a secured negative boolean person switch tracked by the
  Registrar. A person is unwelcome if e is Banned or if at least one
  part of em is unwelcome. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, an
  unwelcome person CANNOT register or be registered, and e is
  immediately deregistered if e is ever a player. Designations of
  unwelcomeness are secured.

  Unwelcomeness is to be used only to make a social statement that
  the Agoran community no longer wishes to interact with certain
  persons; in particular, it is not to be used to acquire gameplay
  advantage. As such, an unwelcome person SHOULD NOT, under any
  circumstances, attempt to bypass unwelcomeness, and e SHOULD
  carefully consider the circumstances of eir becoming unwelcome
  before participating in public or discussion fora.

    Registering by publishing that you want to be a player is a

    gets around rules limitations on "registering by announcement".

    The rules don't bind recently deregistered players to avoid
    re-registering, they merely declare such attempts ineffective.
    Also, agreeing to be bound by some of the rules doesn't count as
    agreeing to be bound by all of them.
