  Firstly: Each of these is a ritual act:
  - Performing a cabinet order
  - Assigning a judgement
  - Awarding ribbons
  - Once per week per report type, publishing a report
  - Once per week per player, nominating for office
  - Once per week per player, voting

  Secondly: Once for each ritual act, any player, including the
  player who performed the ritual act, CAN, by announcement, declare
  the ritual number. A ritual number is a number that starts at 0,
  and can be at most 1 greater than any other declared ritual
  number. A purported attempt to declare the ritual number is a
  self-ratifying attestation that such attempt was successful and
  that the ritual number was declared.

  Thirdly: Once, each time a unique positive multiple of 41 is
  declared, in the same message the declarer CAN, by announcement,
  have qualifying players lift The First Speaker in a powerful dance
  around the fountain, while also announcing that those players'
  gain 1 radiance, in such a way that is unambiguous and clear, so
  that in fact, those players' do gain 1 radiance. This does not
  increase their radiance by 2, nor does it increase it by 3 or 4. 5
  is right out.

  Fourthly: Players are qualifying under this rule if:
  - they are active
  - do not have the highest radiance
  - are not tied for the highest radiance
