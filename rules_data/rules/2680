    Agoran week, provided such publishing fulfilled a Rules-defined

    first time in an Agoran week.
  - For each person, eir submitting a ballot on an Agoran decision
    for the first time in an Agoran week.

  When a ritual act is performed, any player CAN, within 7 days, by
  announcement anoint a ritual number, specifying the ritual act and
  the new ritual number. The anointed ritual number must be 0 or not
  more than 1 greater than the greatest previously anointed ritual
  number.

  When a positive integral multiple of 41 is anointed as a ritual
  number for the first time, the person who does so CAN, by
  announcement, Raise the First Speaker in a powerful dance around
  the Town Fountain. Doing so causes each player qualifying under
  this Rule to gain 1 radiance.

  A player is qualifying under this Rule if and only if e is active,
  does not have the highest radiance of any player, and is not tied
  for the highest radiance among players.
