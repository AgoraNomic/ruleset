  The Tailor is an office, and the recordkeepor of Ribbons.

  For each type of Ribbon, <type> Ribbon Ownership is a secured
  negative boolean person switch, tracked by the Tailor in eir
  monthly report. Laudability is a secured person switch with
  non-negative integer possible values, defaulting to 0, tracked by
  the Tailor as part of eir monthly report. When a person owns more
  types of ribbons than eir Laudability, eir Laudability is set to
  the number of types of ribbons e owns.

  To "award a person a <Ribbon type>" is to flip that person's
  <that type> Ribbon Ownership to True. A person "owns a <Ribbon
  type>" if eir <that type> Ribbon Ownership is True.

  A person qualifies for a type of Ribbon if e has earned that type
  of Ribbon within the preceding 7 days (including earlier in the
  same message).

  While a person owns all types of Ribbon, that person can Raise a
  Banner by announcement. This causes that person to win the game.
  When a person wins this way, for each type of Ribbon, that
  person's <type> Ribbon Ownership is flipped to False.

  The types of Ribbon, and the methods of obtaining them, are as
  follows:

  Red (R): When a proposal is adopted and changes at least one rule
  that, immediately before or after the change, has Power >= 3, its
  proposer earns a Red Ribbon.

  Orange (O): When a proposal is adopted via a referendum on which
  no valid ballots were AGAINST (after evaluating conditionals), its
  proposer earns an Orange Ribbon.

  Green (G): While a person holds an voluntary office, has done so
  continuously for the past 30 days, and has not failed to perform
  any duties of that office within the appropriate time limits
  during those 30 days, that person qualifies for a Green Ribbon.

  Emerald (E): When a person wins an election, e earns an Emerald
  Ribbon.

  Cyan (C): When a person deputises for an office or is the delegate
  for an office while its holder is on vacation, and that person has
  not held or deputised for that office within the past 7 days, that
  person earns a Cyan Ribbon.

  Blue (B): When a person assigns a judgement to a CFJ, and has
  never violated a time limit to assign a judgement to that CFJ,
  nor ever self-filed a motion to reconsider that CFJ, that person
  earns a Blue Ribbon.

  Magenta (M): When, during Agora's Birthday, a person publicly
  acknowledges it, that person earns a Magenta Ribbon.

  Ultraviolet (U): When a person is awarded the Patent Title
  Champion, that person earns an Ultraviolet Ribbon, unless the
  Champion title was awarded as the result of winning the game via
  this rule.

  Violet (V): When a person is awarded a Patent Title other than
  Champion or a degree, that person earns a Violet Ribbon.

  Indigo (I): When a person is awarded a degree, that person earns
  an Indigo Ribbon.

  Platinum (P): The Speaker qualifies for a Platinum Ribbon.

  Lime (L): A person qualifies for a Lime Ribbon if three or more
  proposals adopted in the preceding 7 days had that person as a
  coauthor.

  White (W): A player qualifies for a White Ribbon if e has never
  previously owned a White Ribbon (including under previous
  rulesets). A player who has been registered for the past 30+ days
  or 180+ cumulative days and has never acted on eir own behalf to
  cause another person to gain a White Ribbon (including under a
  previous ruleset) CAN act on eir own behalf to award a White
  Ribbon to another person by announcement.

  Black (K): An instrument CAN, as part of its effect, cause a
  person to earn a Black Ribbon. When this occurs, this Rule awards
  that person a Black Ribbon.

  Gray (A): The Tailor CAN award a Gray Ribbon by announcement,
  unless e has done so earlier in the month. E is ENCOURAGED to
  award such a Ribbon in the same message in which e publishes eir
  monthly report.

  Transparent (T): A person qualifies for a Transparent Ribbon while
  the number of other types of Ribbon that that person qualifies
  for, earns, and/or was awarded within the previous 7 days is at
  least 5.
  
  While a person qualifies for a type of Ribbon:

    - If e has not owned that type of Ribbon within the preceding 7
      days, any player CAN, by announcement, award em that type of
      Ribbon.

  Qualifying for ribbons is secured. Earning ribbons is secured.
