name: Popular Proposal Proposer Privilege
power: 1.0
text: |
  For a referendum, let F be the total number of valid ballots
  resolving to FOR, A be the same for AGAINST, and T be the total
  number of valid ballots.  The referendum's popularity is equal to
  (F - A)/T. The Assessor SHOULD publish the popularity of each
  referendum when resolving it.

  The author of the most popular sponsored proposal adopted in the
  last 7 days CAN once gain one Legislative Card by announcement,
  provided that no referenda initiated in the same message as it
  remain unresolved. If there is a tie, all authors of the tied
  proposals can do so once each.
