  Barrels are a currency tracked by the Coopor (an office) in eir
  monthly report. A player CAN Corner the Market by paying a fee of
  100 barrels.  When a player corners the market, e wins the game.

  A bargain is a specification consisting of a title, a payout (a
  number of barrels between 1 and 10), and a tender (a list of 4 or
  more rules-defined card types with at least two of the types being
  different; a type may be repeated, with each repeat being a
  separate element on the list).

  A player CAN cash out a specified bargain that's "on the barrel",
  by announcement, provided that, in the same message, e paid cards
  (possibly spread over multiple sets) to successfully earn rules-
  defined products, and those cards match all of the cards types in
  that bargain's tender.  The payment of a particular card instance
  can only match a single tender element for the single cashing out
  of a bargain.

  When a player cashes out a bargain on the barrel, e gains the
  payout for that bargain.

  The Coopor CANNOT cash out a specific bargain in the 14 days after
  putting that bargain on the barrel.
