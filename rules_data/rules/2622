  Pended is an untracked negative boolean proposal switch.

  Any player CAN pay 1 Pendant to flip the Pended switch of a
  specified proposal to True. When e does so, the proposal becomes
  sponsored.

  The Promotor CAN, with 2+X support, flip the Pended switch of a
  proposal in the Proposal Pool to true. For this, X is equal to the
  number of times e has done so in the past 7 days.

  Any player CAN, without objection, flip the Pended switch of a
  proposal in the Proposal Pool to true.

  A proposal with a Pended switch set to True is 'pending'.
