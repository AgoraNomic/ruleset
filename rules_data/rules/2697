  Bounty Amount is an untracked player switch. Its possible values
  are all integers from 0 to 10 inclusive, where 0 is the default.

  Twice each month, each player CAN, by announcement, put a bounty
  on a specified player. Doing so increases the specified player's
  Bounty Amount by 1.

  Immediately after an alive player is eliminated, the shooter gains
  a number of spendies equal to the target's Bounty Amount, and then
  the target's bounty amount is flipped to 0.

  The shooter SHOULD publish the target's Bounty Amount at the time
  of the elimination when e eliminates a target with a non-zero
  Bounty Amount.

  A player CAN wipe the slate clean by announcement if the match
  state is none and no one has done so in the current quarter. Upon
  doing so, all bounty amounts are flipped to zero.
