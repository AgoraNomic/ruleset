  Festivity is a secured singleton switch, whose possible values are
  integers ranging from 0 inclusive to the number of defined types
  of Ribbon exclusive, and defaulting to 0. Festivity is tracked in
  the Tailor's monthly report. In addition, while Festivity is
  non-zero, the Tailor SHALL announce its value each week; a public
  document purporting to be such an announcement is self-ratifying.
  A Festival is ongoing whenever Agora's Festivity is non-zero.

  If Agora's Festivity has had the same non-zero value for 14 days
  or more, or if it has a non-zero value and fewer than 5 players
  are Festive, then any player CAN flip it to 0 by announcement.
  
  A Festive person is a person whose Laudability is greater than or
  equal to Agora's Festivity. An N-Festive person is a person who
  would be Festive, were Agora's Festivity N.

  For any integer N greater than Agora's Festivity, an N-Festive
  player CAN flip Agora's Festivity to N with 4 support from other
  N-Festive players, unless Agora's Festivity has had a value
  greater than or equal to N in the past 21 days.
