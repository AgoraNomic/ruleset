  Festivity is a secured singleton switch, whose possible values are
  integers ranging from 0 inclusive to the number of defined types
  of Ribbon exclusive, and defaulting to 0. While Agora's Festivity
  is 0, Festivity is tracked in the Tailor's monthly report.
  Otherwise, it is tracked in the Tailor's weekly report.

  If Agora's Festivity has had the same nonzero value for 14 days or
  more, or if it has a nonzero value and fewer than 5 players are
  Festive, then any player CAN flip it to 0 by announcement.
  
  A person whose Laudability is greater than or equal to Agora's
  Festivity is Festive. Any other person is not Festive.

  A player who would be Festive if the Festivity was N CAN Start a
  Rank N Festival, where N is an integer greater than Agora's
  Festivity, with 4 support from other players who would be Festive
  if the Festivity was N, except that a Rank N Festival CANNOT be
  started if Agora's Festivity has had a value grater than or equal
  to N in the past 21 days. Upon a Rank N Festival starting, Agora's
  Festivity is flipped to N.
