  The following terms are defined. These definitions are used when a
  rule includes a term in all caps, and provide guidance in
  determining the ordinary-language meaning of a term when a rule
  includes a term otherwise. Earlier definitions take precedence
  over later ones. If a rule specifies one or more persons in
  connection with a term, then the term applies only to the
  specified person(s).
