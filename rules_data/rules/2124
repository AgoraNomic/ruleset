  A Supporter of an intent to perform an action is an eligible
  entity who has publicly posted (and not withdrawn) support for an
  announcement of that intent. An Objector to an intent to perform
  an action is an eligible entity who has publicly posted (and not
  withdrawn) an objection to the announcement of that intent.

  A document that authorizes a dependent action, by default,
  implicitly asserts that all players are eligible to support or
  object to an intent to perform that action; if the document is a
  rule, conflicts about eligibility (including conflicts with such
  an implicit assertion) are resolved using the normal procedures.
  However, the previous sentence notwithstanding, the initiator of
  the intent is not eligible to support it.

  Agora is Satisfied with an intent to perform a specific action
  unless at least one of the following is true:

  1. The action is to be performed Without N objections, and there
     are at least N Objectors to that intent.

  2. The action is to be performed With N support, and there are
     fewer than than N Supporters of that intent.

  3. The action is to be performed with N Agoran consent, and the
     number of Supporters of the intent is less than or equal to N
     times the number of Objectors to the intent.

  The above notwithstanding, if an action is to be performed without
  N objections or with N Agoran consent, and an objection to an
  intent to perform it has been withdrawn within the past 24 hours,
  then Agora is not Satisfied with that intent.

  The above notwithstanding, Agora is not satisfied with an intent
  if the Speaker has objected to it in the last 48 hours.

  A person CANNOT support or object to an announcement of intent
  before the intent is announced, or after e has withdrawn the same
  type of response.
