  Hats are a secured player switch defaulting to "none" with the
  following possible values and associated meanings for the player's
  current focus:

    none: no particular focus

    armored helm: competing for wins and in sub-games

    dunce cap: expressing regret or acknowledging a mistake

    floral wreath: resolving conflict

    green eyeshade: maintaining accurate records

    hard hat: repairing problems in the rules

    jaunty beret: exploring creative expression

    jester's cap: bringing levity and humor

    judicial wig: ruling on CFJs and interpreting the rules

    knitted cap: finding loopholes and exploits

    plain hat: simplifying the rules

    rugged fedora: researching Agoran and Nomic history

    sleeping cap: reducing eir participation in Agora

    steampunk hat: creating new game mechanics

    traditional mortarboard: conducting research and writing theses

  A player CAN change eir hat at any time by notifying the
  recordkeepor for eir hat (publicly or privately). The recordkeepor
  for a player's hat is the player emself. Rules to the contrary
  notwithstanding, reporting on one's own hat is OPTIONAL.

  Hats do not otherwise limit or restrict a player's actions in any
  way, and every player is ENCOURAGED to participate in all aspects
  of the game regardless of eir current hat.
