  The horses Run at the start of each week, unless the horses were
  not motivated within the last week.

  When the horses run, each player gains 1 hoof, movement resolves,
  and then if any horses have a Race Position of 16 or more and a
  Race Place of none, those horses cross the finish line in
  alphabetical order of their names.

  When a horse crosses the finish line:

  * If no horse has a Race Place of first, the horse's Race Place is
    set to first.

  * Otherwise, if no horse has a Race Place of second, the horse's
    Race Place is set to second.

  * Otherwise, the horse's Race Place is set to third and the race
    ends, and no horse can cross the finish line until the horses
    are next motivated.
