  Promises are a class of assets, tracked by the Notary. Their
  essential attributes are their text and creator. A consenting
  player CAN, by announcement, grant a specified entity a promise,
  specifying its text and becoming its creator. A promise's owner is
  referred to as its bearer. Promises with the same text, creator,
  and bearer are fungible. Promises with the same text and creator
  SHOULD be referred to by the same title, but the title is not an
  essential attribute of the promise, just a way of referring to it.

  A promise's bearer CAN, by announcement, cash the promise,
  provided that any conditions for cashing it specified by its text
  are unambiguously met. By doing so, e acts on the creator of the
  promise's behalf, causing the creator to act as if e published the
  promise's text, and destroys the promise. The bearer SHOULD recite
  the promise's essential attributes in the same message e cashes
  it.

  In a promise's text, "the bearer" (or the like) refers to the
  promise's bearer, and "this promise" (or the like) refers to the
  promise. The text of the promise can refer to the context of the
  message in which it is cashed, but the context of the message does
  not otherwise change the meaning of the promise.

  The Library is an entity and CAN own promises. Any player CAN take
  a specified promise from the Library by announcement, provided e
  cashes the promise in the same message. Any player CAN revoke a
  specified promise from the Library without objection.
