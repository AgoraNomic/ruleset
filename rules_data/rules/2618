  Promises are a class of assets, tracked by the Notary. Their
  essential attributes are their text and creator. A consenting
  player CAN, by announcement, grant a specified entity a promise,
  specifying its text and becoming its creator. A promise's owner is
  referred to as its bearer. Promises with the same text, creator,
  and bearer are fungible. Promises with the same text and creator
  SHOULD be referred to by the same title, but the title is not an
  essential attribute of the promise, just a way of referring to it.

  The creation of promises is secured. The text of a promise CANNOT
  be altered after it is created.

  A player (the casher) CAN, by announcement, cash a promise,
  provided that both a) any conditions for cashing it specified by
  its text are unambiguously met, and b) either the casher is the
  promise's bearer, or the promise is owned by the Library. By doing
  so, e acts on the creator of the promise's behalf, causing the
  creator to act as if e published the promise's text, and destroys
  the promise.  However, to limit recursion, no promise can be
  cashed during the execution of another promise unless it existed
  before the execution of that promise began. The bearer SHOULD
  recite the promise's essential attributes in the same message e
  cashes it.
 
  In a promise's text, "the bearer" and "the casher" (or the like)
  both refer to the player who cashed the promise, and "this
  promise" (or the like) refers to the promise. The text of the
  promise can refer to the context of the message in which it is
  cashed, but the context of the message does not otherwise change
  the meaning of the promise.

  The Library is an entity and CAN own promises.

  The creator of a promise CAN take or revoke it from the Library by
  announcement, unless the promise's text unambiguously designates
  it as irrevocable. Any player CAN revoke a specified promise from
  the Library without objection. If a promise specifies expiration
  conditions then any player CAN by announcement destroy it while
  the expiration conditions are unambiguously met.
