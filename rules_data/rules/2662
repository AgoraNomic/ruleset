  Except as otherwise specified by the rules, the owner of a bird
  CAN play with it by announcement, specifying any values needed to
  interpret the bird's effects.

  When a bird is played with, the Rule defining that bird applies
  the effects in that bird's scroll, and then that bird is
  transferred to Agora.
