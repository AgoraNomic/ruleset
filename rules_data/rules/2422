name: Voting Strength
power: 3
text: |
  The voting strength of an entity on an Agoran decision is an
  integer between 0 and 15 inclusive, defined by rules of power 2
  or greater. If not otherwise specified, the voting strength of
  an entity on an Agoran decision is 3.

  When multiple rules set or modify an entity's voting strength on
  an Agoran decision, it shall be determined by first applying the
  rule(s) which set it to a specific value, using the ordinary
  precedence of rules, and then applying the rules, other than
  this one, which modify it, in numerical order by ID. Finally, if
  the result of the calculation is not an integer, it is rounded
  up, and then if it is outside the allowable range of values for
  voting strength, it is set to the minimum value if it was less
  and the maximum value if it was more.

  A player CAN Buy Strength by paying 1 Extra Vote and specifying a
  current Agoran decision on which e is a voter. For each time a
  player has Bought Strength on a decision, eir voting strength is
  1 greater on that decision. If the decision is on a proposal, and
  the proposal's chamber and the player's focus are the same value,
  then eir voting strength is instead 2 greater on that decision.
  A player CANNOT Buy Strength for the same decision more than 3
  times.
