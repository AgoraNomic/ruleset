  When the rules authorize an investigator to issue an Indictment
  for a violation, e CAN do so by announcement, specifying a fine of
  blots to be issued and the perpetrator and making an argument for
  the conviction of the accused.

  When an investigator has issued an Indictment, the perpetrator may
  state a defence. Within 10 days but no less than 4 days after the
  indictment has been issued, the judge CAN and SHALL initiate two
  Agoran Decisions, one to determine whether to convict the
  perpetrator and one to determine whether to accept the indictment.
  For these decision, the vote collector is the Judge and the voting
  method is AI-majority with AI=1.5. When initiating the decisions,
  the Judge SHALL, in the same message, publish the full texts of
  the Indictment and the defence. If both decisions are resolved as
  ADOPTED, the investigator CAN, by announcement, and SHALL impose
  the fine stated in the indictment. If the decision to convict is
  resolved as ADOPTED but the decision to accept is resolved as
  REJECTED, the investigator CAN issue a new Indictment. If the
  decision to convict is resolved as REJECTED, a fine SHALL NOT be
  imposed for the crime stated in the indictment.

  The Judge of the Indictment is the first of the following players
  who is neither the investigator nor the perp: the Arbitor, the
  Speaker, the Prime Minister. If this still fails to specify a
  player, then the Indictment lacks a Judge until that changes.

  If it would be ILLEGAL or INEFFECTIVE for the Investigator to levy
  a fine for the stated crime, all decisions associated with the
  Indictment cease to exist, and the Judge and Investigator are
  freed of any obligations of this rule.
