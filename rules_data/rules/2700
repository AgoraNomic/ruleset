  Candles are a fixed currency tracked by the Illuminator.

  Contests are the only entities permitted to own candles, and any
  candles held by any other entity are immediately destroyed.

  A player CAN pay a fee of 1 spendie to grant 1 candle to a
  contest.

  As explicitly and unambiguously permitted by a contest's body, a
  party to that contest CAN bestow a prize by an announcement
  clearly identifying the recipient player, the amount of radiance
  to award (N), and the relevant contest. Upon doing so, if the
  specified contest possesses at least N candles the following
  happen in order: N of its candles are destroyed, then the
  specified player gains N radiance.
