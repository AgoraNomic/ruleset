  Whenever a zombie (1) has Agora for a master, (2) is not a lot in
  an ongoing auction, (3) has a resale value greater than 0, and (4)
  has not been won as an auction lot in the past 14 days, then the
  Registrar CAN put that zombie (along with any other zombies that
  fulfill the same conditions) up for auction.

  In a timely fashion after the beginning of each month, the
  Registrar SHALL either initiate such an auction or, if no zombies
  meeting these conditions existed at the beginning of the month,
  announce that no such auction is necessary.

  For such an auction, the lots are the qualifying zombies, ordered
  at the discretion of the Registrar. The Registrar is the
  announcer, and the minimum bid is 1.  Rules  to the contrary
  notwithstanding, the master of a zombie CANNOT bid in a zombie
  auction. If a player becomes a zombie's master, all eir bids in
  zombie auctions that have not ended are withdrawn.

  For the purpose of such a auction, to transfer a zombie to a
  player is to set that zombie's master switch to that player, and
  Agora CAN perform such transfers of the appropriate lots to
  auction winners.

  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, if a player's master switch
  is flipped while a zombie auction in which e is a lot is ongoing,
  then the winner of that lot NEED NOT pay Agora eir bid and Agora
  CANNOT and NEED NOT transfer the contents of the lot to the
  winner.
