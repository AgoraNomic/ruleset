  Whenever a zombie has Agora for a master and has a resale value
  greater than 0, and when eir talisman is not currently a lot in an
  auction and has not been won as an auction lot in the past 14
  days, then the Registrar CAN put that zombie's talisman (along
  with any other talismans that fulfill the same conditions) up for
  auction.

  In a timely fashion after the beginning of each month, the
  Registrar SHALL either initiate such an auction or, if no
  talismans meeting these conditions existed at the beginning of the
  month, announce that no such auction is necessary.

  For such an auction, each lot consists of the talisman for one
  zombie, ordered at the discretion of the Registrar. The Registrar
  is the auctioneer, and the minimum bid is 1. The method to be used
  for this auction is the zombie auction method if such a method
  exists, or otherwise the default auction method.
