  If a CFJ about the effectiveness, possibility, or legality of a
  change in the gamestate has been assigned a judgement of
  PARADOXICAL continuously for between 7 and 90 days, then that
  case's initiator, CAN, by announcement, Transcend Logic,
  specifying that CFJ, provided that e has not already won the game
  with respect to that CFJ or to a CFJ linked to it. When a person
  transcends logic, e wins the game.

  A player who wins in this fashion SHOULD submit a proposal to
  prevent the paradox from arising again.
