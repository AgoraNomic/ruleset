  If a CFJ about the effectiveness, possibility, or legality of a
  change in the gamestate has been assigned a judgment of
  PARADOXICAL continuously for at least 7 days, and e has not done
  so already in respect of that CFJ, then that case's initiator,
  CAN, by announcement, Transcend Logic. When a person transcends
  logic, e wins the game.

  A player who wins in this fashion SHOULD submit a proposal to
  prevent the paradox from arising again.
