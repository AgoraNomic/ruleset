name: Scoring Numbers
power: 1.0

  Whenever an inquiry case with an ID number is assigned a
  judgement, if it had never previously been assigned a judgement,
  its judge scores its ID number, unless its initiator had initiated
  4 or more other CFJs earlier in the same week that it was
  initiated.

  Whenever a distributed proposal is adopted, its author scores its
  ID number, unless its author had submitted 8 or more proposals
  earlier in the same week that it was submitted.

  Whenever a player scores a number as described in this rule, the
  Numerator CAN once, and SHALL in a timely manner, grant its author
  (and, if the number was scored due to the adoption of a proposal,
  also a randomly chosen other player who voted FOR on a referendum
  to adopt that proposal) a number card for each digit in that
  number, whose type is that digit.

  Officers SHALL NOT assign ID numbers to distributed proposals or
  CFJs that are out of sequence, but are given reasonable discretion
  to determine what "in sequence" means (e.g. officers may choose
  whether to include or exclude in the numbering sequence entities
  whose proposal or CFJ status is disputed or unclear). ID numbers
  that are more than 5 digits long cannot be scored (this is an
  exception to the other paragraphs of this rule and takes
  precedence over them).
