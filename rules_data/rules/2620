  Cards are a type of currency with a corresponding Product.
  Products are also currencies. The types of Cards and their
  corresponding Products are:
  
  * Victory Cards and Victory Points.
  * Justice Cards and Blot-B-Gones
  * Legislative Cards and Pendants
  * Voting Cards and Extra Votes

  A player CAN pay a 'set' of X Cards of the same type to gain Y
  corresponding Products. The value of X determines the value of Y
  in the following ways:

  * 1 Card = 1 Product
  * 2 Cards = 3 Products
  * 3 Cards = 6 Products
  * 4 Cards = 10 Products

  A player CANNOT pay more than 4 Cards as one 'set'.

  Cards and Products are tracked by the Treasuror.
