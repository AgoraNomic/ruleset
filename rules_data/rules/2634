  The Total Buoyancy is a singleton integer switch, tracked by the
  Treasuror in eir monthly report.

  The Treasuror CAN, by announcement, set the Total Buoyancy to a
  specified value approximately equal to the sum of all coin
  balances at a specified point within the first Eastman week of the
  current month. Whenever e does so, e SHALL endeavor to calculate
  the correct sum for eir chosen point. E SHALL set the Total
  Buoyancy once a month.

  The Treasuror may exercise reasonable judgement in calculating the
  Total Buoyancy. The Total Buoyancy will be deemed set so long as
  the value chosen by the Treasuror is not obviously and grossly
  incorrect. The Treasuror may set the Total Buoyancy more than once
  a month, but SHOULD NOT do so unless there is reason to believe
  eir previous setting of the value failed.
