  The Total Buoyancy is a singleton integer switch, tracked by the
  Treasuror in eir monthly report.

  The Treasuror CAN, by announcement, set the Total Buoyancy to a
  specified value approximately equal to the sum of all coin
  balances at a specified point within the first Eastman week of the
  current month. Whenever e does so, e SHALL endeavor to calculate
  the correct sum for eir chosen point. E SHALL set the Total
  Buoyancy once a month.

  The Treasuror CAN and MAY exercise reasonable judgement in
  calculating the Total Buoyancy. The Total Buoyancy will be deemed
  set so long as the value chosen by the Treasuror is not obviously
  and grossly incorrect. The Treasuror CAN and MAY set the Total
  Buoyancy more than once a month, but SHOULD NOT do so unless there
  is reason to believe eir previous setting of the value failed.
