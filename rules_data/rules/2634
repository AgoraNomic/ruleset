  The Total Buoyancy and Buoyancy Target are singleton integer
  switches, tracked by the Treasuror in eir weekly report.

  The Treasuror CAN, by announcement, set the Buoyancy Target to a
  specified value approximately equal to the sum of all coin
  balances at a specified point within the last week, and SHALL do
  so each time e publishes eir weekly report.

  The Treasuror may exercise reasonable judgement in calculating the
  Buoyancy Target. The Buoyancy Target will be deemed set so long as
  the value chosen by the Treasuror is not obviously and grossly
  incorrect. However, the Treasuror SHALL NOT deliberately introduce
  error into the Buoyancy Target.

  At the beginning of each month, the Total Buoyancy is flipped to
  the Buoyancy Target.
