  Except as otherwise specified by the rules, the owner of a stone
  CAN wield it by announcement specifying any values needed to
  interpret the stone's effects.

  If a stone has a frequency, then it is IMPOSSIBLE to wield that
  stone if it has been previously wielded in the same Agoran time
  interval as indicated by its frequency (e.g. if its frequency is
  daily, if it has been wielded in the same Agoran day).

  When a stone is wielded, the Rule defining that stone applies the
  effects in that stone's scroll.
