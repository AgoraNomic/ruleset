  Except as otherwise specified by the rules, the owner of a stone
  CAN wield it by announcement specifying any values needed to
  interpret the stone's effects.

  A stone with a frequency that has been wielded in the corresponding
  Agoran time interval is Hot for the remainder of the time period
  (e.g. if the frequency is daily, it is hot for the remainder of the
  Agoran day it was wielded during).

  While a stone is hot, it is IMPOSSIBLE to wield it.

  When a stone is wielded, the Rule defining that stone applies any
  effects that it defines as occurring when the stone is wielded.

  The wielding of stones is secured.
