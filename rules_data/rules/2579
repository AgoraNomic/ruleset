  If the Rules associate payment of a set of assets (hereafter the
  fee for the action; syns: cost, price, charge) with performing an
  action, that method for performing that action is a fee-based
  method.

  If the fee is a non-integer quantity of a fungible asset, the
  actual fee is the next highest integer amount of that asset.

  To use a fee-based method, an entity (the Actor) who is otherwise
  permitted to perform the action must announce that e is performing
  the action; the announcement must specify the correct set of
  assets for the fee and indicate intent to pay that fee for the
  sole purpose of using that method to perform that action.

  Upon such an announcement:

    - If the Rules specify a recipient for the fee, and the Actor
      CAN transfer that specified fee from emself to the recipient,
      then that fee is transferred from the Actor to the recipient
      and the action is performed simultaneously;

    - If the Rules do not specify a recipient, and the Actor CAN
      destroy the specified fee in eir possession, then that fee in
      eir possession is destroyed and the action is performed
      simultaneously.

    - Otherwise, no changes are made to asset holdings and the
      action is not performed.

  If a fee-based method to perform an action has a fee of no assets,
  that action CAN be performed by announcement, but the actor SHOULD
  announce that there was a 0 or empty fee.
