  If the Rules associate payment of a set of assets (hereafter the
  fee for the action; syns: cost, price, charge) with performing an
  action, that method for performing that action is a fee-based
  method.

  If the fee is a non-integer quantity of a currency, the actual fee
  is the next highest integer amount of that asset.

  To use a fee-based method, an entity (the Actor) who is otherwise
  permitted to perform the action must announce that e is performing
  that action; such announcement must clearly and unambiguously set
  forth intent to pay a fee for the sole purpose of using that
  method to perform that action. Additionally, such announcement
  must either clearly and unambiguously specify the correct set of
  assets for that fee or use simplified wording (e.g. "I buy X")
  that makes the intended fee reasonably clear and unambiguous (in
  particular, without stating an incorrect fee).

  Upon such an announcement:

    - If the Rules specify a recipient for the relevant fee, and the
      Actor CAN transfer that fee from emself to the recipient, then
      that fee is transferred from the Actor to the recipient and
      the action is performed simultaneously;

    - If the Rules do not specify a recipient, and the Actor CAN
      destroy the relevant fee in eir possession, then that fee in
      eir possession is destroyed and the action is performed
      simultaneously.

    - Otherwise, no changes are made to asset holdings and the
      action is not performed.
