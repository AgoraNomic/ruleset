  A talisman is an indestructible asset, tracked by the Registrar,
  and with ownership wholly restricted to players and Agora. There
  exists exactly one talisman for each player, and no other
  talismans; if one does not exist for a certain player, it is
  created in eir posession.  Talismans CAN only be transferred as
  explicitly specified by the rules.  The creation, destruction, and
  transfer of talismans is secured.

  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a player CAN, by
  announcement, transfer the talisman for em to emself. The master
  of a player is the entity that possesses the talisman for em. A
  player who is eir own master is active; any other player is a
  zombie (syn. inactive).

  The master of a zombie CAN act on behalf of em, except a master
  CANNOT act on behalf of a zombie to:
    - initiate, support, object to, or perform a dependent action;
    - act on behalf of that zombie's zombies;
    - bid in a zombie auction;
    - enter a contract, pledge, or other type of agreement;
    - initiate a Call for Judgement;
    - create blots;
    - deregister.

  If a master causes a zombie to perform an ILLEGAL action, the
  master commits the Class 4+N Crime of Masterminding (where N is the
  class of the illegal action).

  If an active player who was a zombie has not received a Welcome
  Package since e most recently ceased being a zombie, and if eir
  resale value was less than 2 at any point during eir most recent
  time as a zombie, then any player CAN cause em to receive a
  Welcome Package by announcement.
