  A stone is a unique indestructible fixed asset defined by the
  rules. To define a stone, the definition must include:
    (i) A name unique among stones;
   (ii) A description of the stone's properties
  (iii) Optionally, a frequency, which must be one of daily, weekly,
        monthly, or quarterly.

  Ownership of stones is entirely restricted to Agora and players.
  If a stone is owned by the Lost and Found Department or in
  abeyance, it is immediately transferred to Agora.

  The Stonemason is a sortitioned office, and the recordkeepor of
  stones.
  
  A stone is immune if and only if a rule of power 2 or more says it
  is immune and it is not owned by Agora; otherwise it is
  non-immune.
