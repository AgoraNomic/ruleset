  A stone is a unique indestructable liquid asset defined by the
  rules. To define a stone, the definition must include:
    (i) A name unique among stones;
   (ii) The escape risk of the stone, which must be a percentage between
        0% and 100% inclusive;
  (iii) A scroll, which is a document specifying the effects of the
        stone
   (iv) Optionally, a frequency, which must be one of daily, weekly,
        monthly, or quarterly.

  Ownership of stones is entirely restricted to Agora and active
  players.  If a stone is owned by the Lost and Found Department or
  in abeyance, it is immediately transferred to Agora.

  The Stonemason is an office, and the recordkeepor of stones.
