name: Sortition Procedure
power: 2.0
text: |
  A player CAN by announcement initiate a sortition for a vacant
  sortitioned office for which a sortition is not ongoing. At the
  beginning of each quarter, for each sortitioned office for which a
  sortition is not ongoing, the ADoP CAN once by announcement, and
  SHALL in a timely fashion, initiate a sortition.

  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a sortition CANNOT be
  initiated for an office for which a sortition is ongoing.

  When a sortition is initiated, it enters the lots period. Any
  player CAN by announcement become an option for that office during
  this period. If a person ceases to be a player during this period,
  e also ceases to be an option for each current sortition.

  Seven days after a sortition is initiated, its lots period ends.
  The ADoP CAN by announcement, and SHALL in a timely fashion after
  a lots period ends, randomly select one of the options for that
  office. When e does so, that player becomes the officeholder for
  that office, then the sortition ends.

  If a sortition's lots period has ended, and the sortition has no
  valid options, then it immediately ends with no selection, and any
  duty to select an option with respect to it is discharged.

  If a sortition is ever ongoing for a non-sortitioned office (or
  for an office that no longer exists), that sortition immediately
  ends.
