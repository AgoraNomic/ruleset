  The Webmastor is an office.

  The Webmastor's monthly report includes a Directory, a Changelog,
  a Warning Log, and an Error Log. The Directory lists notable
  currently maintained public resources. The Changelog lists notable
  changes to resources. The Warning Log lists notable potential
  issues, such as inaccurate or aging resources or unintended issues
  with a public resource. The Error Log lists notable losses of
  resources - where a resource has become inaccessible,
  unmaintained, or unusable. Where 'notable' is used in this rule
  its meaning is up to the Webmastor's discretion.
