  The Unit of Flotation is equal to 1/2500 times the Total Buoyancy,
  rounded up, and is tracked in the Treasuror's weekly report.  A
  boatload of something is a quantity of that thing equal in count
  to the Unit of Flotation.

  The Treasuror is ENCOURAGED to arrange for the new Total Buoyancy
  and Unit of Flotation to be published as close as possible to the
  beginning of the month.
