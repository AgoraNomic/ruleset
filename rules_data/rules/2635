  The Unit of Flotation is equal to 1/2500 times the Total Buoyancy,
  unrounded. A boatload of something is a quantity of that thing
  equal in count to the Unit of Floatation.

  The Floating Rate Schedule is part of the Treasuror's monthly
  report. It contains the Total Buoyancy, the Unit of Flotation, and
  the real value of every quantity that is expressed in boatloads in
  a rule or regulation. The Treasuror is ENCOURAGED to also consider
  including quantities in contracts.  The Treasuror SHOULD publish
  the Floating Rate Schedule immediately after setting the Total
  Buoyancy.

  When taking an action, a person SHOULD expand all quantities that
  are expressed in boatloads.
