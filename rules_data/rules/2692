  Vitality is an untracked player switch with possible values of
  alive, unalive, and ghostly (default). Bangs are a fungible asset.

  Match state is an untracked singleton switch with possible values
  none (default), initializing, and ongoing. If the match state is
  none and has not changed in the past 7 days, a player CAN by
  announcement flip it to initializing. When the match state is
  flipped to none or to initializing, each player becomes ghostly
  (if e is not already), then all bangs are destroyed.

  While the match state is initializing:
  * A player CAN by announcement incarnate, thereby flipping eir
    vitality to alive.
  * A player CAN by announcement trigger the match, provided the
    match state has not changed in the past 7 days.
  * At the beginning of each Agoran week, if any player triggered
    the match in the previous Agoran week, and if there at least
    three alive players, the match state is flipped to ongoing,
    after which each alive player is granted 2 bangs.

  If the match state is ongoing, no player has won the game as a
  result of this Rule in the past 28 days, and a single player was
  alive at the beginning of the week, that player CAN stand alone by
  announcement. When a player stands alone, eir radiance is
  increased by 30, then the match state is flipped to none (if it is
  not already).

  When a player takes an action that causes one or more vitalities
  or bang balances to change, e SHOULD recite all such changes in
  the same message as which e takes that action. A document reciting
  all bang balances and vitalities SHOULD be published and ratified
  as needed.
