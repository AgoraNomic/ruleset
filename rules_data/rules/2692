  Bangs are a fungible asset.

  Vitality is an untracked player Switch with possible values of
  Invulnerable, Alive, Unalive, or Ghostly (default). A player with
  a Vitality that is not Ghostly is called “corporeal”, else e is
  called "ghostly".

  To "incarnate" is to flip one's Vitality to Invulnerable. A
  ghostly player CAN incarnate by announcement, provided there are
  only Invulnerable or Ghostly players.

  Each corporeal player SHOULD list eir Vitality and Bang Balance in
  all eir messages.

  Any player CAN publish a report of all Bang Balances and
  Vitalities. Such a report SHOULD be made and Ratified Without
  Objection as needed.

  Each Alive player CAN eliminate a specified Alive player by paying
  a fee of 2 bangs. Eliminating a player makes em Unalive, and then
  grants em 1 bang.

  Any Alive player CAN Stand Alone by announcement, if there are no
  other players that are Alive, and no person has won the game by
  doing so in the past 7 days. When a player Stands Alone, e wins
  the game. If a player won the game in this manner 4 days ago, then
  the match is reset.

  When the match is reset, each player is set to Ghostly, all bangs
  are destroyed, and then each player gains 1 bang.

  When 7 days have passed since the match is reset, all Invulnerable
  players have eir Vitality set to Alive.

  When 14 days have passed since a player was last eliminated, the
  match resets, and then each player that was alive immediately
  before the match reset gains 1 bang.
