  Any player CAN, with notice, transfer the talisman for an active
  player who has not made a public announcement in the past 60 days
  to Agora.

  Resale value is a secured natural switch for zombies, tracked by
  the Registrar, with a default value of 2. Whenever the talisman
  for a zombie is transferred to a player, that zombie's resale value
  is decreased by 1. At the end of a zombie auction, the resale
  value of every zombie that is an excess lot in that auction
  decreases by 1.

  The talisman for a zombie with zero resale value CANNOT be
  transferred to any player other than that zombie.

  Any player CAN, with notice:
    - If a zombie has been a zombie for the past 90 days and not had
      Agora for a master during any of that time, transfer the
      talisman for em to Agora;
    - If a player possesses more than one talisman for persons other
      than emself, specify and transfer one of those talismans to
      Agora;
    - Deregister a zombie whose resale value is zero and whose
      master is Agora.

  The Registrar SHALL track the date for each zombie on which Agora
  was most recently eir master. The Registrar SHALL perform all
  POSSIBLE actions in the preceding paragraph in a timely fashion
  after first reporting their possibility via the facts in eir
  weekly report.
