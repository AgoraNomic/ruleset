name: Submitting a CFJ to the Referee
power: 2
text: |
  When a person initiates a Call for Judgement, e CAN, optionally,
  submit it to the Referee by announcement. All persons are
  ENCOURAGED to submit a case to the Referee only when there is a
  good reason not to let it be processed by the Arbitor as usual.

  When a CFJ is submitted to the Referee, the Referee receives all
  obligations and powers for the specific case that the Arbitor
  would otherwise receive due to being Arbitor.  This takes
  precedence over Rules that would otherwise assign duties and
  powers regarding a judicial case to the Arbitor.
