power: 3

  When the rules provide that an instrument takes effect, it can
  generally:

  1. enact a rule. The new rule has power equal to the minimum of
     the power specified by the enacting instrument, defaulting to
     one if the enacting instrument does not specify or if it
     specifies a power less than 0.1, and the maximum power
     permitted by other rules. The enacting instrument may specify a
     title for the new rule, which if present shall prevail. The ID
     number of the new rule cannot be specified by the enacting
     instrument; any attempt to so specify is null and void.

  2. repeal a rule. When a rule is repealed, it ceases to be a rule,
     its power is set to 0, and the Rulekeepor need no longer
     maintain a record of it.

  3. reenact a rule. A repealed rule identified by its most recent
     rule number MUST be reenacted with the same ID number and the
     next change identifier. If no text is specified, the rule is
     reenacted with the same text it had when it was most recently
     repealed. If the reenacting proposal provides new text for the
     rule, the rule SHOULD have materially the same purpose as did
     the repealed version. Unless specified otherwise by the
     reenacting instrument, a reenacted rule has power equal to the
     power it had at the time of its repeal (or power 1, if power
     was not defined at the time of that rule's repeal). If the
     reenacting instrument is incapable of setting the reenacted
     rule's power to that value, then the reenactment is null and
     void.

  4. amend the text of a rule.

  5. retitle a rule.

  6. change the power of a rule.

  A rule change is any effect that falls into the above classes.
  Rule changes always occur sequentially, never simultaneously. If a
  specification would ever be interpreted as causing multiple
  changes to happen at once, it is instead interpreted as attempting
  to cause them to occur separately, in the order they are listed in
  the specification.

  Any ambiguity in the specification of a rule change causes that
  change to be void and without effect. An inconsequential variation
  in the quotation of an existing rule does not constitute ambiguity
  for the purposes of this rule. Furthermore, if the change being
  specified would be clear to any reasonable player, the
  specification is not ambiguous, even if it is incorrect or unclear
  on its face. This provision does not prevent the specification of
  undesirable changes; for instance, an amendment which adds a typo
  is not corrected to remove the typo.

  A rule change is wholly prevented from taking effect unless its
  full text was published, along with an unambiguous and clear
  specification of the method to be used for changing the rule, at
  least 4 days and no more than 60 days before it would otherwise
  take effect.

  This rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be
  created, modified, or destroyed, or by which an entity can become
  a rule or cease to be a rule.

    If a low-power rule states that an officer can repeal the rule
    under certain circumstances, then the rule cannot actually be
    repealed by this process, because the officer, not being an
    instrument, is categorically incapable of performing rule
    changes; this is different from the situation where a rule can
    be triggered to repeal itself.
