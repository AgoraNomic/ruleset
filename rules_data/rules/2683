  The Absurdor is a sortitioned office.

  The Boulder's Height is a singleton integer switch defaulting to
  0, tracked by the Absurdor.

  The Boulder's Slope is a singleton integer switch defaulting to 1,
  tracked by the Absurdor.

  Each player CAN, once a week, by announcement, push the boulder.
  When a player pushes the Boulder, its Height is increased by 1.
  At the beginning of each week, if the boulder was pushed in the
  previous week at least as many times as the Boulder's Slope, then
  the Boulder's Slope is increased by 1; otherwise, the Boulder's
  Height is set to 0, and the Boulder's Slope is set to 1. The
  Absurdor SHOULD list the largest Height and Slope of the Boulder
  ever reached in eir report.

    The Height switch is not associated with any specific dimension
    or direction; merely pushing the Boulder increases its Height,
    regardless of how a player announces e does so.
