  A Tournament is a sub-game of Agora specifically sanctioned to be
  initiated as a tournament by the Rules. Each time that one or more
  winners of a tournament are determined before it concludes, that
  person or those persons win the game. A tournament concludes when
  its regulations state that it concludes. Additionally, if it has
  not previously concluded, a tournament concludes 3 months after
  its initiation.

  A Tournament is governed by a set of regulations, created in
  accordance with its parent rule, which have binding control over
  those who freely consent to oversee or participate in the
  tournament and over the tournament itself. When a tournament is
  initiated, its governing regulations are enacted. Once the
  tournament is concluded, these regulations cease to have any
  effect, and CAN be repealed by any player by announcement. A
  Tournament's regulations collectively have Mint Authority.

  Unless otherwise specified by the tournament's regulations, the
  gamemaster of a tournament is the person who initiated it.

  A tournament's regulations can provide for the enactment,
  amendment, and repeal of regulations for that tournament; if the
  regulations are silent, the gamemaster CAN, with 2 Agoran consent,
  enact, amend, or repeal such regulations. Any regulations so
  enacted are deemed to be regulations of the same tournament.
