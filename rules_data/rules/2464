  A Tournament is a sub-game of Agora specifically sanctioned to be
  initiated as a tournament by the Rules. The person who initiates a
  tournament is its Gamemaster. Each time that one or more winners
  of a tournament are determined before it concludes, that person or
  those persons win the game. A tournament concludes when its
  regulations state that it concludes. Additionally, if it has not
  previously concluded, a tournament concludes 3 months after its
  initiation.

  A Tournament is governed by a set of regulations, created in
  accordance with its parent rule, which have binding control over
  those who freely consent to play the tournament and over the
  tournament itself. Once the tournament is concluded, these
  regulations cease to have any effect, and CAN be repealed by any
  player by announcement. A Tournament's regulations collectively
  have Mint Authority.
