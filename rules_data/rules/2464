  A Tournament is a sub-game of Agora specifically sanctioned to be
  initiated as a tournament by the Rules. The person who initiates a
  tournament is its Gamemaster. If a winner of a tournament is
  determined within within 3 months of its initiation, that person
  or persons win the game, otherwise the tournament concludes with
  no winner.

  A Tournament is governed by set of regulations, created in
  accordance with its parent rule, which have binding control over
  those who freely consent to play the tournament and over the
  tournament itself. Once the tournament is concluded, these
  regulations cease to have any effect, and CAN be repealed by any
  player by announcement. A Tournament's regulations collectively
  have Mint Authority.
