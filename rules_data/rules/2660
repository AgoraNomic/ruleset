  A bird is a unique indestructible liquid asset defined by the
  rules. To define a bird, the definition must include:
    (i) A name unique among birds;
   (ii) A scroll, which is a document specifying the effects of the
        bird.

  Ownership of birds is entirely restricted to Agora and active
  players. If a bird is owned by the Lost and Found Department or in
  abeyance, it is immediately transferred to Agora.

  The Avicultor is an office, and the recordkeepor of birds.

  A player that is not Beast Permitted SHALL NOT transfer a bird e
  owns to another player; doing so is the Class 3 infraction of
  Unpermitted Beast Transit.
