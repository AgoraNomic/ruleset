  The Treasuror CAN conduct a L&FD Auction if no other L&FD Auction
  ongoing. The Treasuror MUST do so at least once a month, if there
  is at least one asset in the Lost and Found Department of an
  auction-ready type.

  Coins, promises, and all private assets are excluded from L&FD
  Auctions. The non-excluded type(s) of asset(s) that the Lost and
  Found Department owns more of than any other type of non-excluded
  asset are auction-ready.

  When conducting a L&FD Auction, the Treasuror specifies an
  auction-ready asset type. Each asset of that type that the L&FD
  owns is a lot.

  The currency of a L&FD Auction is coins (minimum bid 1).
