  For each type of Ribbon, there is a type of Glitter with the same
  name. An attempt to award Glitter is INEFFECTIVE if the type of
  Glitter is not specified.

  Each time a player is awarded a type of Glitter, the Tailor CAN
  once by announcement, and SHALL in an officially timely fashion,
  grant the player N+1 boatloads of coins, where N is the number of
  players who did not own the corresponding type of Ribbon at the
  time of the award. The amount payable for each type of glitter is
  tracked in the Tailor's weekly report.
