  "Each type of Ribbon has a corresponding type of Glitter with the
  same name. A player qualifies for a type of Glitter when e
  qualifies for the same type of Ribbon while already owning such a
  Ribbon. If a player has not been awarded that type of Ribbon or e
  corresponding type of Glitter since e last earned or came to
  qualify for that type of Ribbon, and has not been so awarded five
  or more times within the past 24 hours, any player CAN award em
  that type of Glitter by announcement. When a player gains a type
  of Glitter, the Tailor SHALL in an officially timely fashion and
  CAN once by announcement award em N/2 boatloads of coins rounded
  up, where N is the number of players that did not own the
  corresponding type of Ribbon at the time of the award. The amount
  payable for each type of Glitter is tracked in the Tailor's weekly
  report.
