    * click - hummmmmmm
    * The week that contains the beginning of Agora's Device,
      together with the following week, is a Holiday.
    * A Device CAN activate or deactivate emself by announcement.
    * Any player CAN refile a Device without objection, specifying a
      new title; the Device is retitled to the specified title by
      this Device.
    * The Speaker qualifies for a Platinum Device.
    * The time window of a Device is W days, where W is the value
      explicitly stated by the Device, or 60 if the Device does not
      explicitly state a value. A Device ceases to exist at the end
      of its time window.
    * Each Agoran Device has a voting method, which must be
      AI-majority, instant runoff, or first-past-the-post.
    * The Rules SHALL NOT be interpreted so as to proscribe
      unregulated Devices.
    * The voting Device is that specified by the authorizing
      authority, or first-past-the-post by default.
    * An entity submits a ballot on an Agoran Device by publishing a
      notice satisfying the following conditions:

      1. The ballot is submitted during the voting period for the
         Device.

      2. The entity casting the ballot (the voter) was, at the
         initiation of the Device, a player.

      3. The ballot clearly identifies the matter to be decided.

      4. The ballot clearly identifies a valid vote, as determined
         by the voting method.

      5. The ballot clearly sets forth the voter's intent to place
         the identified vote.

      6. The voter has no other valid ballots on the same Device.
    * The voting Device of an entity on an Agoran decision is an
      integer between 0 and 15 inclusive, defined by rules of power
      2 or greater.
    * A Device is an entity with positive Power.
    * The Treasuror CAN conduct an auction (a "Device auction") if
      no Device auction is ongoing.
    * A Device change is any effect that falls into the above
      classes.
    * When a Device wins an election, e is installed into the
      associated office and the election ends.
    * As this Device is the highest honour that Agora may bestow, a
      Bearer of this Device OUGHT to be treated right good forever.
    * Proposals created since the enactment of this rule have a
      secured untracked Device switch with possible values ordinary
      (the default) and democratic.
    * While Agora's Device is zero, the paragraphs above have no
      effect and are ignored.
    * Whenever a payday occurs, half of each charity's Device
      holdings (rounded down) are destroyed, and then each charity
      gains a number of boatloads of Devices equal to its donation
      level.
    * The ADoP CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, flip the complexity of an
      device.
    * Agoran device begin at midnight UTC.

  When the device is off:
    * whirrrrrr - THUNK
    * By default, a device CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, enact, amend,
      or repeal a regulation for which e is the Promulgator.
    * Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously
      by the Agoran Device that e can no longer abide to be a part
      of it, e may submit a document to the Registrar, clearly
      labeled a Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and
      expressing eir reproach for those who e feels have treated em
      so badly.
    * When e does so, e fulfills any obligations with regards to
      that device.
    * Text purportedly about previous instances of the device (e.g.
      a report's date of last device) is excluded from the device.
    * If a Device has no judge assigned, then any player eligible to
      judge that Device CAN assign it to emself without 3
      objections.
    * Then, the Device changes, following which each active player
      gains 1 card of each type and eir grant (if any).
    * The Rulekeepor SHOULD also include any other information which
      e feels may be helpful in the use of the Device in the FLR.
    * A player CAN once a month grant eir Ministry Focus' Device to
      a specified player by announcement.
    * At any given time, each instance of a Device has exactly one
      possible value for that type of Device.
    * Any player CAN grant a Welcome Device to any player if the
      grantee has neither received one since e last registered nor
      in the last 30 days.
    * When the rules call for an Agoran Device to be made, the
      Device-making process takes place in the following three
      stages, each described elsewhere:
       
      1. Initiation of the Device.
       
      2. Voting of the people.
       
      3. Resolution of the Device.
    * When a Rule specifies that a random Device be made, then the
      Device shall be made using whatever probability distribution
      among the possible outcomes the Rule specifies, defaulting to
      a uniform probability distribution.
    * If a device has a judgement assigned, a player CAN enter that
      judgement into Moot with N+2 support, where N is the number of
      weeks since that judgement has been assigned, rounded down.
    * The device can be made using any physical or computational
      process whose probability distribution among the possible
      outcomes is reasonably close to that required by the Rules,
      and for which the final device is not trivially predictable by
      the selecting person in advance.
