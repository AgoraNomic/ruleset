   An Infraction is a violation of a rule. The person who committed
   an infraction is its infracter.

   The Investigator for an infraction is the Referee unless e is the
   infracter. Otherwise, it is the Arbitor.

   The Class of an infraction is 2 unless a rule specifies a
   different Class for it.

   The Base of an infraction is N, where N is the number of
   previously-investigated, unforgiven infractions that have been
   committed by the same person in the last 30 days. The previous
   notwithstanding, if the base of an infraction would be greater
   than its class, the infraction's base is equal to its class.

   Within 14 days of an infraction being committed, or if the
   infraction has been noted in the past 60 days, the Investigator
   CAN investigate the infraction by announcement, specifying a
   number of blots between the Base and the Class of the infraction,
   inclusive. When e does so, that many blots are created in the
   possession of the infracter.

   The previous notwithstanding, an Investigator CANNOT investigate
   an infraction that has already been investigated or forgiven. The
   Investigator of a noted, unforgiven infraction SHALL investigate
   the infraction in a timely fashion after it has been noted;
   failure to do so is the Class N infraction of Favoritism, where N
   is equal to the Class of the noted infraction.

   A player CAN, by announcement, "note" an unforgiven infraction
   committed by any other player in the last 14 days, specifying the
   incident and the rule it violates (or name of the Infraction if
   it has one); but a player CANNOT note an infraction that has
   already been investigated.

   The Referee's weekly report contains a list of noted and
   investigated Infractions committed in the previous week.
