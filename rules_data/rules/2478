  A player CAN by announcement Point eir Finger at a player (the
  perp); the announcement is INEFFECTIVE if it does not explicitly
  name the perp, cite a specific rule or named crime, and specify an
  alleged violation of that rule or commission of that crime by that
  person.

  When a player Points a Finger, the investigator SHALL investigate
  the allegation and CAN, and in a timely fashion SHALL, conclude
  the investigation by:

  - Issuing a Warning to the perp, as described elsewhere;

  - Imposing the Cold Hand of Justice on the perp for the cited rule
    violation, as described elsewhere;

  - Issuing an Indictment against the perp for the cited rule
    violation, as described elsewhere; or

  - if e believes that no rules violation occurred or that it would
    be ILLEGAL or INEFFECTIVE to levy a fine for it, announcing the
    Finger Pointing to be Shenanigans.

  Initiating a Finger Pointing found to be Shenanigans is ILLEGAL
  and the Class 0+N Crime of Unjustified Gesticulation, where N is
  the number of times e has previously committed the crime in the
  current Agoran Week. The investigator of a finger pointing SHALL
  NOT point eir finger for the Crime of Unjustified Gesticulation
  with respect to that finger pointing.

  The above notwithstanding, the investigator CANNOT resolve a
  Finger Pointing for which e is the perp.

  The Referee is by default the investigator for all Finger
  Pointing. When the Referee's Finger is Pointed or the Referee is
  the perp, the Arbitor is the investigator.

  The Referee CANNOT Point eir Finger at the Arbitor, and the
  Arbitor CANNOT point eir finger at the Referee.

  A high crime is any crime specified as being class 4 or greater.
  The Referee CANNOT levy the Cold Hand of Justice to punish a high
  crime, the other provisions of this rule notwithstanding.

  The player who initiated the most Finger Pointings that resulted
  in a Warning, Indictment, or Cold Hand of Justice in the previous
  Agoran Week CAN once grant emself a Justice Card by announcement.
