  An Infraction is a violation of a SHALL or SHALL NOT in a rule.
  The infracter for an infraction is the person who committed the
  infraction.

  The Investigator for an infraction is the Referee unless e is the
  infracter. Otherwise, it is the Arbitor.

  The Class of an infraction is 2 unless a rule specifies a
  different Class for it.

  When a player commits an infraction, N blots are created in eir
  possession, where N is the class of the infraction.

  A player CAN, by announcement, "note" an infraction committed by
  any other player in the last 7 days by specifying the incident and
  the rule that contains the SHALL or SHALL NOT (or name of the
  Infraction if it has one). The Investigator of an infraction CAN
  and SHALL once by announcement grant 1 boatload of coins to the
  player that noted the infraction in a timely manner after e does
  so.

  The Referee's weekly report contains a list of Infractions
  committed in the previous week.

  The Investigator of an infraction CAN, by announcement, "reduce"
  the infraction by specifying a reason and a number between 1 and
  half of N (inclusive and rounded up), where N is the class of the
  infraction. When e does so, N (or all if N is greater than all)
  blots in possession of the infracter are expunged. E SHOULD do so
  if e believes the infraction was inconsequential or unavoidable,
  or if e believes the infracter has fixed it or shown remorse.

  The Investigator of an infraction CAN, by announcement, "increase"
  the infraction by specifying a reason and a number between 1 and
  half of N (inclusive and rounded down), where N is the class of
  the infraction. When e does so, N blots are created in the
  infracter's possession. E SHOULD do so if e believes the
  infraction was harmful, belligerent, or intentional.

  The above notwithstanding, an infraction CANNOT be increased or
  reduced if it happened more than 14 days ago or it has already
  been increased or reduced.
