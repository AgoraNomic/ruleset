power: 3

  An action is regulated if: (1) the Rules limit, allow, enable, or
  permit its performance; (2) the Rules describe the circumstances
  under which the action would succeed or fail; or (3) the action
  would, as part of its effect, modify information for which some
  player is required to be a recordkeepor.

  A Regulated Action CAN only be performed as described by the
  Rules, and only using the methods explicitly specified in the
  Rules for performing the given action. The Rules are not to be
  interpreted so as to proscribe unregulated actions.

  The above notwithstanding, sending a message (in general or with
  specific attributes) is never a regulated action; however, the
  rules may be interpreted so as to proscribe sending public
  messages (in general or with specific attributes).

    Actions that the rules state a player SHALL NOT perform are
    considered to be regulated actions.

    Rule 2125 is an interpretive principle applied to the rules
    as a whole and not to any individual rule. For a method to
    be explicitly specified, it must actually specify a way
    that the action can be realized; it is not enough that a
    rule claims there is a method. Circular reasoning cannot be
    used to permit an action or to provide a method.

    Sending messages to fora is not regulated, only the potential
    actions contained therein.

    Whether coming into existence is regulated depends on the thing
    that is coming into existence. Coming into existence is
    regulated for rules-defined entities and is not regulated for
    entities of which the rules decline to take notice; for entities
    that are not defined by the rules, but of which the rules take
    notice, such as persons, coming into existence is not regulated
    but the collateral consequences (e.g. assigning switch values)
    are.
