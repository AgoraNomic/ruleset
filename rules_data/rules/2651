  A holder of an elected office who did not become its holder by
  winning an election, and has not won an election for that office
  since, is an interim holder. An elected office that is either
  vacant or has an interim holder is an interim office.

  An office is term-limited if the most recent election for that
  office was resolved more than the length of that office's term
  prior. The term for the office of Prime Minister is 90 days. The
  term for all other elected offices is 180 days.

  A player CAN initiate an election for a specified elected office:

  a) with 2 support, if either the office is interim or term-
  limited, and provided that the initiator becomes a candidate in
  the same message.

  b) By announcement, if e is the ADoP (or, if the office is the
  ADoP, if e is the Assessor) and the office is interim, or if e is
  the holder of that office.

  Once per quarter, the ADoP CAN and SHALL publish a Notice of
  Election specifying between 2-4 term-limited offices (if there
  fewer than 2 term-limited offices, the ADoP MUST instead list all
  of them).  Such a notice initiates elections for the specified
  offices.  The ADoP SHOULD prioritize offices that have gone
  longest since their last elections.

  The above notwithstanding, an election for an office CANNOT be
  initiated if one is already in progress.
