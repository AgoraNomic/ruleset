  The Buttonmastor is an office.

  The Button is a singleton switch tracked by the Buttonmastor with
  instants in time as possible values, defaulting to the instant
  this rule was created.

  Buttonclass is a player switch tracked by the Buttonmastor with
  possible values Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet
  or None, defaulting to None.

  A player CAN, once a week, by announcement, press the button.

  When a player presses the button, two things happen:

  1. The Button is flipped to the instant e did it.

  2. That player's Buttonclass is flipped to a value depending on
     the amount of hours passed between the previous value of The
     Button and the current one, as specified below:

     * Less than 24: Red;
     * 24 or more, but less than 48: Orange;
     * 48 or more, but less than 72: Yellow;
     * 72 or more, but less than 96: Green;
     * 96 or more, but less than 120: Blue;
     * 120 or more, but less than 144: Indigo;
     * 144 or more: Violet.

  If value of The Button is more than 168 hours in the past, this
  rule repeals itself.

  Players are ENCOURAGED to brag on their Buttonclass.
