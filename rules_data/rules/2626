  Any player CAN, by announcement, certify a specified proposal (as
  a patch), causing it to become pending.

  A player SHALL NOT certify a proposal unless its sole function is
  to minimally rectify a bug, error, or ambiguity (a problem) that
  relates to a) an office e holds; or b) a CFJ, open within the last
  week, of which e is the judge. Certifying a proposal in violation
  of this paragraph is the Class-4 Crime of Uncertain Certification.
  A player certifying a proposal SHOULD explain why doing so does
  not violate this paragraph.

  For the purposes of this rule:

  1. A bug is a situation in which a rule operates in a way that is
     clearly contrary to legislative intent or common sense.
  2. An error is a change introduced by apparent mistake, such as
     the self-ratification of an incorrect report or a typo in a
     rule amendment.
  3. An ambiguity is a state of affairs in which reasonable players
     could disagree about the operation of the rules or the state of
     a rule defined property.
  4. A minimal rectification is one that resolves the problem
     without doing substantially more than is necessary to resolve
     it.  For instance, rectification that uses more slightly words
     than necessary to resolve the problem may still be minimal,
     whereas a rectification that makes rule changes unrelated to
     fixing the problem would not be.
  5. A problem relates to an office if it plausibly affects the area
     of the game the office is responsible for and relates to a CFJ
     if it could plausibly be interpreted to affect that CFJ's
     outcome.
