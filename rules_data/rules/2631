  Donation Level is a natural switch for contracts, tracked by the
  Notary, with a default of 0 and a maximum of 25. A contract with
  nonzero donation level is called a Charity.

  The Notary CAN flip a contract's donation level to a non-default
  value with 3 Agoran consent. This SHOULD only be done if the
  contract's provisions ensure that its funds received from Agora
  will be used solely for the betterment of Agora. Any player CAN
  flip a contract's donation level to 0 with Agoran consent.

  Whenever a payday occurs, half of each charity's coin holdings
  (rounded down) are destroyed, and then each charity gains a number
  of boatloads of coins equal to its donation level.
