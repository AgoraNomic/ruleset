  The Veblen is a unique indestructible fixed asset tracked by the
  Abusrdor, with ownership entirely restricted to players and Agora.
  If the Veblen would otherwise be in abeyance, or if it is owned by
  the Lost and Found Department, it is immediately transferred to
  Agora.

  The Veblen cost is a secured singleton positive integer switch
  tracked by the Absurdor and with default value one.

  A player CAN pay a fee of X spendies, where X is an integer not
  less than the current Veblen cost, to set the Veblen cost to X+1.
  When e does so, if e does not own the Veblen, the Veblen is
  transferred to em.

  The owner of the Veblen SHOULD conspicuously show off eir
  ownership of it from time to time.
