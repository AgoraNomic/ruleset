  The Veblen is a unique indestructible fixed asset tracked by the
  Abusrdor, with ownership entirely restricted to players and Agora.
  If the Veblen would otherwise be in abeyance, or if it is owned by
  the Lost and Found Department, it is immediately transferred to
  Agora.

  The Veblen cost is a secured singleton positive integer switch
  tracked by the Absurdor and with default value one.

  A player who does not own the Veblen CAN pay a fee of X spendies
  to purchase the Veblen, where X is an integer not less than the
  current Veblen cost. When e does so, the Veblen is transferred to
  em, then the Veblen cost is set to X+1.

  The owner of the Veblen SHOULD conspicuously show off eir
  ownership of it from time to time.
