  The Veblen is a unique indestructible fixed asset tracked by the
  Absurdor, with ownership entirely restricted to players and Agora.
  If the Veblen would otherwise be in abeyance, or if it is owned by
  the Lost and Found Department, it is immediately transferred to
  Agora.

  The Veblen cost is a secured singleton positive integer switch
  tracked by the Absurdor and with default value one.

  A player CAN pay a fee of X spendies, where X is an integer not
  less than the current Veblen cost, to set the Veblen cost to X+1.
  When e does so, if e does not own the Veblen, the Veblen is
  transferred to em.

  If the Veblen has not been transferred or devalued within the past
  month, then a player CAN devalue the Veblen by announcement, thus
  setting the Veblen cost to half its current value (rounded up).

  The owner of the Veblen SHOULD conspicuously show off eir
  ownership of it from time to time.

  If the Veblen does not exist and no one has Created Something E
  Cannot Destroy in the past week, any player CAN, by announcement,
  Create Something E Cannot Destroy. When e does so, e wins the
  game, and the Veblen is created in eir possession. A player who
  wins in this fashion SHOULD submit a proposal to prevent the
  destruction from arising again.
