  The Veblen is a unique indestructible fixed asset.

  Ownership of the Veblen is entirely restricted to Agora and
  players. If the Veblen is owned by the Lost and Found Department
  or in abeyance, it is immediately transferred to Agora.

  The Veblen Cost is a secured singleton switch with values of
  positive integers and a default of 1.

  Any player CAN pay a fee of X Spendies to transfer the Veblen to
  to emself, where X is a value greater than or equal to the current
  Veblen Cost. Upon doing so, e gains ownership of the Veblen, and
  the Veblen Cost is set to X+1.

  The Veblen Cost and the ownership of the Veblen are tracked by the
  Absurdor.

  The owner of the Veblen SHOULD conspicuously show off eir
  ownership of it from time to time.
