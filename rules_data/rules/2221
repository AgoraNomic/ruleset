  Any player CAN clean a rule without objection by specifying one or
  more corrections to spelling, grammar, capitalization, formatting,
  and/or dialect, or to whether a synonym or abbreviation is used in
  place of a word or phrase, in the rule's text and/or title; when e
  does so, if any text changes were specified, that rule is amended
  by this rule by applying the changes as a single amendment
  (failing as a whole if any fail); then, if any title changes were
  specified, that rule is retitled by this rule by applying the
  changes as a single retitling (failing as a whole if any fail).

  Any player CAN refile a rule without objection, specifying a new
  title; the rule is retitled to the specified title by this rule.

  Cleaning rules is secured. Refiling rules is secured.

    For a cleaning to replace a word with another word as
    a synonym, the two words must have exactly the same
    meaning.

    Changing an undefined term to a defined term is not a rule
    change allowed via cleaning, even if the undefined term is due
    to a typo/error.
