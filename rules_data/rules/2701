  A rare stamp is a stamp that is the only one of its type that
  exists.

  Stamp scamp is a singleton switch tracked by the Collector with
  possible values of each player and null (default). Upon a correct
  announcement that a specified player owns more rare stamps than
  any other player, the stamp scamp switch is flipped to that
  player.

  If no person has done so by this mechanism in this quarter, the
  value of the stamp scamp switch, if a player, CAN by announcement
  cause another specified player to gain one stamp of that player's
  type.
