  Once per month, the Stonemason CAN publish a collection notice by
  announcement, specifying all necessary information and choices.
  The Stonemason SHALL publish such a notice in a timely fashion
  after the beginning of each Agoran month.

  A stone is immune if it has been granted immunity, as defined by
  other rules, since the last collection notice or if it is
  currently owned by Agora.

  A collection notice includes, for every non-immune stone, a random
  choice of whether that stone escapes, escaping with probability
  equal to its escape risk. When a collection notice is published,
  stones that escape are transferred to Agora in an order specified
  by the collection notice.
