  Once per month, the Stonemason CAN publish a collection notice by
  announcement, specifying all necessary information and choices.
  The Stonemason SHALL publish such a notice in a timely fashion
  after the beginning of each Agoran month.

  A stone is immune if it has been granted immunity, as defined by
  other rules, since the last collection notice or if it is
  currently owned by Agora.

  A collection notice includes zero or more random choices of
  whether each stone escapes. Each choice results in escape with
  probability equal to its escape risk; a stone escapes if any
  choice selects escape. When a collection notice is published,
  stones that escape are transferred to Agora in an order specified
  by the collection notice.

  If a stone is immune, there are zero escape choices; otherwise,
  there is one choice if the stone was used in the previous Agoran
  month, or two if it was not.
