  announcement, specifying all necessary information and choices. The
  Stonemason SHALL publish such a notice in a timely fashion after
  the beginning of each Agoran month.

  A Collection Notice includes a random numbers between 1 and 6; this
  is the Escape Minimum.

  When a Collection Notice is published, for each player, half

  than the Escape Minimum are transferred to Agora. A Collection
  Notice includes selections of which eligible stones escape (which
  shall prevail in determining which stones are transferred). the
