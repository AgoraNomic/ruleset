  A stone is immune if and only if it is defined as such by the
  rules of power not less than 2.

  A stone is immune if it is owned by Agora. A stone is immune if it
  has been granted immunity since the last collection notice. The
  granting of immunity is secured.

  Once per month, the Stonemason CAN publish a Collection Notice by
  announcement, specifying all necessary information and choices. The
  Stonemason SHALL publish such a notice in a timely fashion after
  the beginning of each Agoran month.

  A Collection Notice includes a random integer from 1 to 6; this is
  the Escape Minimum.

  When a Collection Notice is published, for each player, half
  (rounded up) of eir non-immune stones with slipperiness not less
  than the Escape Minimum are transferred to Agora, rules to the
  contrary notwithstanding.  A Collection Notice includes selections
  of which eligible stones escape (which shall prevail in
  determining which stones are transferred). The mossiness of each
  stone that is not transferred is incremented by 1.
