  Once per month, the Stonemason CAN publish a collection notice by
  announcement, specifying all necessary information and choices.
  The Stonemason SHALL publish such a notice in a timely fashion
  after the beginning of each Agoran month.

  A stone is immune if there has been no collection notice after it
  was most recently granted immunity (if ever), as defined by other
  rules.

  A collection notice includes, for every non-immune stone not
  belonging to Agora, a random choice of whether that stone escapes,
  escaping with probability equal to its escape risk. When a
  collection notice is published, stones that escape are transferred
  to Agora in an order specified by the collection notice.
