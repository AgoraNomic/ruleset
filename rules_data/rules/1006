  An Office is a position described as an Office by the Rules.
  Officeholder is an office switch tracked by the ADoP, with
  possible values of any person or "vacant" (default). Each instance
  of the Officeholder switch is secured at the power of the Rule
  defining the associated office (or the power of this Rule, if the
  defining Rule's power is higher). An officer is the holder of an
  office, who may be referred to by the name of that office. If the
  holder of an office is ever not a player, it becomes vacant.

  Imposed offices and sortitioned are offices described as such by
  the rules that define them. All other offices are elected A person
  CANNOT be made the holder of an elected office without eir
  explicit or reasonably implied consent.

  The holder of an elected office CAN resign it by announcement,
  causing it to become vacant. The non-interim holder of an elected
  office CAN, with 3 support, resign the office while appointing
  another player to become the holder of the office, provided that
  other player is one of the Supporters. Any player CAN cause an
  office to become vacant without 2 objections.

  Immediately after a proposal finishes taking effect, if one or
  more offices exist that did not exist prior to the proposal taking
  effect, each such office, if it is vacant, becomes held by the
  author of the proposal.

    This rule does not define the meaning of the term "office", in the sense
    meant by Rule 754, but rather references the usual English
    definition of "office" and governs offices as thus defined.

    A requirement to submit something to an officer is satisfied by
    publishing it, even if that office is vacant at the time.
