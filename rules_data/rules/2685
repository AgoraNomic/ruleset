  The Geologist is an office that tracks crystals.

  A crystal is an asset with secured integer switches identity, size
  (default 0), and instability (default 0).

  At the beginning of each quarter, each crystal whose identity is
  not equal to the ID of any rule in the current ruleset has its
  size increased by 3.

  If a proposal amends or repeals a rule, if a crystal exists whose
  identity equals that rule's id, that crystal absorbs that
  proposal. Otherwise, grant to the author of the proposal a crystal
  with identity equal to the ID of that rule, then that crystal
  absorbs that proposal. Each crystal can only absorb a given
  proposal once by this method.

  When a crystal absorbs a proposal, the following occur in sequence:
  - The size of that crystal is increased by the power of that
    proposal when that proposal's power was greater than 0 (rounded
    down).

  - If that crystal's owner is not the author of that proposal, the
    instability of that crystal is increased by 3.

  - If the instability of that crystal is greater than its size, it
    is transferred to the author of the proposal, then its
    instability becomes equal to its size.

  A player is crystallized if the total size of crystals e owns is
  at least the number of rules in the current ruleset.

  Any player CAN, by announcement, Shatter the System, specifying
  each crystallized player, and provided that no player has done so
  in the past 30 days. When a player does so, each crystallized
  player wins the game.

  If at least 4 days have passed since any player won the game in
  this manner, any player CAN repeal this rule by announcement.
