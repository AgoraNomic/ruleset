  The Geologist is a sortitioned office that tracks crystals.

  A crystal is an indestructible asset with secured integer switches
  identity, size (default 0), and instability (default 0).

  Once a quarter, the Geologist CAN (and SHALL during its first
  Eastman week) publish a Notice of Crystal Growth, upon which each
  crystal whose identity is not equal to the ID of any rule in the
  current ruleset has its size increased by 3.

  If a proposal amends or repeals a rule, if a crystal exists whose
  identity equals that rule's id, that crystal absorbs that
  proposal. Otherwise, grant to the author of the proposal a crystal
  with identity equal to the ID of that rule, then that crystal
  absorbs that proposal. Each crystal can only absorb a given
  proposal once by this method.

  When a crystal absorbs a proposal, the following occur in sequence:
  - The size of that crystal is increased by the power of that
    proposal when that proposal's power was greater than 0 (rounded
    down).

  - If that crystal's owner is not the author of that proposal, the
    instability of that crystal is increased by 2.

  - If that crystal's owner is not the author or coauthor of that
    proposal, the instability of that crystal is increased by 2.

  - If the instability of that crystal is greater than its size, it
    is transferred to the author of the proposal, then its
    instability becomes equal to its size.

  A player is crystallized if the total size of crystals e owns is
  at least the number of rules in the current ruleset.

  A player CAN increase the size of a specified crystal by 1 by
  paying a fee of 11 spendies.

  Any player CAN, by announcement, Shatter the System, specifying at
  least 1 crystallized player, and provided that no person has done
  so in the past 30 days. When a player does so, each crystallized
  player wins the game.

  If a player won the game in this manner 4 days ago, then all
  existing crystals are destroyed.
