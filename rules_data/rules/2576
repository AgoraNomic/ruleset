  Each asset has exactly one owner.

  If ownership of an asset is restricted to a class of entities,
  then that asset CANNOT be gained by or transferred to an entity
  outside that class. By default, ownership of an asset is
  restricted to Agora, players, and contracts, but an asset's
  backing document may modify this.

  If an asset's owner would otherwise be nonexistent, indeterminate,
  or invalid, then it is owned by the Lost and Found Department (if
  possible) or destroyed (otherwise), subject to modification by its
  backing document. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the Lost
  and Found Department can own assets of every type. Assets owned by
  the Lost and Found Department can be transferred or destroyed by
  any player without objection.
