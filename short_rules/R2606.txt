Rule 2606/4 (Power=2.0)
Proposal Classes

      Proposals created since the enactment of this rule have a secured
      untracked Class switch with possible values ordinary (the default)
      and democratic.
      
      When a proposal with an adoption index greater than or equal to
      3.0 is created, its class becomes democratic.
      
      Any player CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, flip an ordinary proposal's
      class to democratic, provided that it is in the Proposal Pool or
      that there is a referendum on it whose voting period has not yet
      ended.
