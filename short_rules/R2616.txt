The Webmastor

      The Webmastor is a sortitioned office.
      
      The Webmastor's monthly report includes a Directory, a Changelog,
      a Warning Log, and an Error Log. The Directory lists notable
      currently maintained public resources. The Changelog lists notable
      changes to resources. The Warning Log lists notable potential
      issues, such as inaccurate or aging resources or unintended issues
      with a public resource. The Error Log lists notable losses of
      resources - where a resource has become inaccessible,
      unmaintained, or unusable. Where 'notable' is used in this rule
      its meaning is up to the Webmastor's discretion.
