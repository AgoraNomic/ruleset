      A Badge is any patent title with the word 'badge' as part of its
      name. A badge SHOULD be used to award multiple persons for
      participating in specific event of note within Agora.  Any player
      CAN award a badge that does not yet exist to three or more persons
      simultaneously, with Agoran consent. The Herald CAN award an
      existing badge to persons without objection.
