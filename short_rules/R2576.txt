Rule 2576/4 (Power=3)
Ownership

      Each asset has exactly one owner.
      
      An asset CANNOT be gained by or transferred to an entity unless
      its backing document specifies that entity can own it. If an
      asset's backing document is otherwise silent on which entities can
      own it, then it can be owned by Agora, players, and contracts.
      
      An asset "in abeyance" is one whose owner is nonexistent,
      indeterminate, or invalid. If an asset would otherwise be in
      abeyance, then it is owned by the Lost and Found Department (if
      possible) or destroyed (otherwise), subject to modification by its
      backing document (provided that the modification either destroys
      it or prevents it from being in abeyance). Rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the Lost and Found Department can own assets of
      every type. Assets owned by the Lost and Found Department can be
      transferred or destroyed by any player without objection.
