Rule 2553/6 (Power=1)
Win by Paradox

      If a CFJ about the effectiveness, possibility, or legality of a
      change in the gamestate has been assigned a judgement of
      PARADOXICAL continuously for between 7 and 90 days, then that
      case's initiator, CAN, by announcement, Transcend Logic,
      specifying that CFJ, provided that e has not already won the game
      with respect to that CFJ or to a CFJ linked to it. When a person
      transcends logic, e wins the game.
      
      A player who wins in this fashion SHOULD submit a proposal to
      prevent the paradox from arising again.
