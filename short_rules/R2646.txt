Rule 2646/2 (Power=3)
Activity

      Activity is a secured player switch tracked by the Registrar, with
      values Active (default) and Inactive.  To flip a player's activity
      to active (inactive) is to activate (deactivate) em.  The date on
      which each player's activity was last changed is part of the
      Registrar's weekly report.
      
      A player CAN, acting as emself, activate or deactivate emself by
      announcement.
      
      Any player CAN, with notice, make a player who has not made a
      public announcement in the past 30 days inactive.
      
      If a player has been inactive continuously for the past 60 days,
      then any player CAN deregister em without 3 objections. The
      Registrar SHOULD attempt to deregister players who meet this
      condition. The publication of intent for such a deregistration
      SHOULD be sent to the inactive player's registered email address
      at the same time that it is published.
