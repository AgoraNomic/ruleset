Rule 107/28 (Power=3)
Initiating Agoran Decisions

      An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
      initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
      to initiate the decision. To be valid, the notice must clearly
      specify the following information:
      
      1. The matter to be decided (for example, "the adoption of
         proposal 4781");
      
      2. The voting method;
      
      3. A clear description of the valid options;
      
      4. The identity of the vote collector; and
      
      5. Any additional information defined by the rules as essential
         parameters.
      
      The initiation of an Agoran decision also initiates the voting
      period for that decision. The default length of the voting period
      is 7 days. Changing the length of a decision's voting period is
      secured at power 2, and it CANNOT be set or changed to more than
      14 days, or less than 5 days for a decision with at least two
      options.
      
      The vote collector for a decision with less than two options CAN
      end the voting period by announcement, if it has not ended
      already, and provided that e resolves the decision in the same
      message.
      
      A public notice purporting to initiate an Agoran decision is a
      self-ratifying attestation that the notice was valid, that the
      person (if any) publishing the notice was authorized to initiate
      the decision, that such a decision was initiated, and that that
      decision's voting period was initiated
      
      The destruction of Agoran decisions is secured. An Agoran
      decision's matter to be decided, voting method, valid options, and
      vote collector are secured at the power of the Rule authorizing
      the initiation of such a decision.
