Rule 107/26 (Power=3)
Initiating Agoran Decisions

      An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
      initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
      to initiate the decision. To be valid, the notice must clearly
      specify the following information:
      
      1. The matter to be decided (for example, "the adoption of
         proposal 4781");
      
      2. The voting method;
      
      3. A clear description of the valid options;
      
      4. The identity of the vote collector; and
      
      5. Any additional information defined by the rules as essential
         parameters.
      
      The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting period
      for the decision. The default length of the voting period is 7
      days. Changing the length of a decision's voting period is secured
      at power 2, and it CANNOT be set or changed to more than 14 days,
      or less than 5 days for a decision with at least two options.
      
      The vote collector for a decision with less than two options CAN
      end the voting period by announcement, if it has not ended
      already, and provided that e resolves the decision in the same
      message.
      
      A public notice purporting to initiate an Agoran decision is a
      self-ratifying attestation that the notice was valid, that the
      person (if any) publishing the notice was authorized to initiate
      the decision, and that such a decision was initiated.
      
      The destruction of an Agoran decision and the causing of an Agoran
      decision to cease being an Agoran decision are secured at the
      power of the Rule authorizing the initiation of such a decision.
