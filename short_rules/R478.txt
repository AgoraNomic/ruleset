Rule 478/43 (Power=3)
Fora

      Publicity is a secured forum switch with values Public,
      Discussion, and Foreign (default), tracked by the Registrar.
      
      The Registrar CAN change the publicity of a forum without
      objection as long as:
      
      1. e sends eir announcement of intent to that forum; and
      
      2. if the forum is to be made public, the announcement by which
         the Registrar makes that forum public is sent to all existing
         public fora.
      
      Each player should ensure e can receive messages via each public
      forum.
      
      A public message is a message sent via a public forum, or sent to
      all players and containing a clear designation of intent to be
      public. A rule can also designate that a part of one public
      message is considered a public message in its own right. To
      "publish" or "announce" something is to send a public message
      whose body contains that thing. To do something "publicly" is
      to do that thing within a public message.
      
      Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
      announcement", that person performs that action by, in a single
      public message, specifying the action and setting forth intent to
      perform that action by sending that message, doing both clearly
      and unambiguously.
      
      Any action performed by sending a message is performed at the time
      date-stamped on that message. Actions in messages (including
      sub-messages) are performed in the order they appear in the
      message, unless otherwise specified. Allowing regulated actions
      performed by sending a message to take place simultaneously must
      be done explicitly and is secured at power 2.
