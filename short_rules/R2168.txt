Rule 2168/10 (Power=2)
Extending the Voting Period

      Whenever the voting period of an Agoran decision would end, and
      the result would be FAILED QUORUM, the length of the voting period
      for that decision is instead increased to 14 days, except if it is
      already that length, provided this has not already happened for
      the decision in question.
      
      Within four days of such an occurrence, the vote collector for the
      decision SHALL issue a humiliating public reminder naming the
      slackers who have not yet cast any votes on it despite being
      eligible players, and CAN end its voting period by announcement
      (resolving it constitutes an implicit announcement that its voting
      period is first ended) if the result would no longer be FAILED
      QUORUM, or if the decision is a referendum on a proposal and no
      voter (other than possibly the proposal's author) has voted FOR.
