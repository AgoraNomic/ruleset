Rule 1698/7 (Power=4)
Agora Is A Nomic

      Agora is ossified if it is IMPOSSIBLE for any reasonable
      combination of actions by players to cause arbitrary rule changes
      to be made and/or arbitrary proposals to be adopted within a
      real-world (UTC) four-week period.
      
      If, but for this rule, the net effect of a proposal would cause
      Agora to become ossified, or would cause Agora to cease to exist,
      it cannot take effect, rules to the contrary notwithstanding. If
      any other single change or inseparable group of changes to the
      gamestate would cause Agora to become ossified, or would cause
      Agora to cease to exist, it is cancelled and does not occur, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.
