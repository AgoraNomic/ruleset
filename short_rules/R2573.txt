Rule 2573/4 (Power=2)
Impeachment

      Any player CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, expel (impeach) the holder
      of a specified voluntary office. When a person is impeached from
      an office, the selection method for that office is immediately
      initiated (if possible). Players SHOULD NOT use this method of
      removal unless the officer has abused the powers of eir office or
      otherwise shown emself unworthy of the trust of Agora.
