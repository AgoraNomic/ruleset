Rule 2125/15 (Power=3)
Regulated Actions

      An action is regulated if: (1) the Rules limit, allow, enable, or
      permit its performance; (2) the Rules describe the circumstances
      under which the action would succeed or fail; or (3) the action
      would, as part of its effect, modify information for which some
      player is required to be a recordkeepor.
      
      A Regulated Action CAN only be performed as described by the
      Rules, and only using the methods explicitly specified in the
      Rules for performing the given action. The Rules are not to be
      interpreted so as to proscribe unregulated actions.
      
      The above notwithstanding, sending a message (in general or with
      specific attributes) is never a regulated action; however, the
      rules may be interpreted so as to proscribe sending public
      messages (in general or with specific attributes).
