Rule 2566/2 (Power=1)
Free Tournaments

      A player who is not the gamemaster of an existing tournament CAN
      initiate a sanctioned tournament with a specified set of
      regulations with 2 Agoran consent. A tournament created using this
      method is called a Free Tournament.
      
      A free tournament CAN be concluded with no winner without 3
      objections. Tournaments SHOULD only be concluded in this manner if
      it is clear that its regulations are malformed or contrary to the
      tournament's intent or that it is IMPOSSIBLE for any player to win
      the tournament.
