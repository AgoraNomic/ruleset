Rule 2577/8 (Power=3)
Asset Actions

      An asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner by announcement,
      subject to modification by its backing document. Attempts to
      destroy no assets are successful. An indestructible asset is one
      defined as such by its backing document, and CANNOT be destroyed
      except as explicitly specified by its backing document; any other
      asset is destructible.
      
      For an entity to gain (historical syn. earn) an asset is for that
      asset to be created in that entity's possession. To grant an
      entity an asset is to create it in eir possession. To grant an
      entity a set of assets is to create each asset in the set in eir
      possession.
      
      For an entity to lose an asset is for that asset to be destroyed
      from that entity's possession. To revoke an asset from an entity
      is to destroy it from that entity's possession.
      
      For entity A to take an asset from entity B is to transfer it from
      entity B to entity A.
      
      An asset generally CAN be transferred (syn. given) by announcement
      by its owner to another entity, subject to modification by its
      backing document. Attempts to transfer no assets are successful. A
      fixed asset is one defined as such by its backing document, and
      CANNOT be transferred except as explicitly specified by its
      backing document; any other asset is liquid.
      
      When a rule indicates creating, destroying, or transferring an
      amount of assets that is not a natural number, the specified
      amount is rounded up to the nearest natural number after all other
      calculations.
