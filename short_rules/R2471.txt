Rule 2471/4 (Power=1)
No Faking

      A person SHALL NOT make a public statement that is a lie.
      
      A public statement is falsy if any of the following was true at
      the time of publication:
      * The statement was not true and the author knew or should have
        known that it was not true.
      * The author did not believe the statement to be true.
      
      A public statement is a lie if it is falsy and any of the
      following is true:
      * The author made the statement with intent to mislead.
      * The author, in the same message, declared the statement to be
        made "under penalty of No Faking" (or similar).
      
      For the purposes of this rule, an attempt to perform an action by
      publishing certain text constitutes an implicit statement that the
      action was EFFECTIVE.
      
      Merely quoting a statement or attempt does not constitute making
      it for the purposes of this rule. Any disclaimer, conditional
      clause, or other qualifier attached to a statement or attempt
      constitutes part of the statement or attempt for the purposes of
      this rule; the truth or falsity of the whole is what is
      significant.
      
      The above notwithstanding, a formal announcement of intent is
      never a lie.
