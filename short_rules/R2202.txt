Rule 2202/10 (Power=3)
Ratification Without Objection

      A public document is part (possibly all) of a public message.
      
      A player CAN, without objection, ratify a specified public
      document.
      
      Ratification Without Objection CANNOT cause the repeal, amendment,
      enactment, or mutation of any Rule, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding.
      
      A player SHALL NOT knowingly use or announce intent to use
      Ratification Without Objection to ratify a (prior to ratification)
      document containing incorrect or Indeterminate information when a
      corrected document could be produced with reasonable effort,
      unless the general nature of the document's error and reason for
      ratifying it is clearly and plainly described in the announcement
      of intent. Such ratification or announcement of intent to ratify
      is the Class 8 Infraction of Endorsing Forgery.
