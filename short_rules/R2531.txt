          of the evidence to have committed the infraction;
      
      (2) at the time the alleged infraction occurred, it was not an
          infraction;
      
      (3) the infraction was for failure to take an action that the
          infracter, through no fault of eir own, COULD NOT have
          performed;
      
      (4) the infraction is for conduct that the infracter, through no

      (5) the infracter could not have avoided the infraction when

          infraction or to the person who committed the infraction.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any attempt to investigate
      an infraction which would result in the creation of blots is

      (2) it would result in a punishment that is blatantly and
          obviously unsuited to the conduct which constitutes the
