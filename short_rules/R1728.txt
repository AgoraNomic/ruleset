Rule 1728/46 (Power=3)
Tabled Actions

      An action is a Tabled Action if the Rules purport to authorize its
      performance via one of the following methods:
      * With N Support, where N is a positive integer.
      * Without N Objections, where N is a positive integer.
      * With N Agoran Consent, where N is a positive integer multiple of
        0.1.
      * With T notice, where T is a time period.
      
      The parameters N and T, if omitted, default to 1 and 4 days,
      respectively (e.g. "without objection" means N=1). If a rule
      defines N as less than 1, it is instead treated as 1.
      
      A person, acting as emself, CAN by announcement table an intent
      (syn.  "intend") to perform a tabled action, clearly,
      conspicuously, explicitly, and without obfuscation specifying the
      action, the method (including non-default parameter values), and,
      optionally, conditions.
      
      A person is the sponsor of such an intent if e tabled it, or if e
      is authorized to perform its action due to holding a rule-defined
      position previously held by the person who tabled it.
