Rule 1789/11 (Power=3)
Cantus Cygneus

      Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously by
      the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part of
      it, e may submit a document to the Registrar, clearly labeled a
      Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and expressing eir
      reproach for those who e feels have treated em so badly.
      
      In a timely fashion after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the
      Registrar shall publish this document along with a Writ of
      Fugiendae Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione, commanding the Player
      to be deregistered. The Registrar shall note the method of
      deregistration for that Player in subsequent Registrar monthly
      Reports.
      
      The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and the
      notation in the Registrar's monthly report will ensure that,
      henceforth, all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of
      FAGE.
