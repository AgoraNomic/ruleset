Rule 2464/8 (Power=1)
Tournaments

      A Tournament is a sub-game of Agora specifically sanctioned to be
      initiated as a tournament by the Rules. Each time that one or more
      winners of a tournament are determined before it concludes, that
      person or those persons win the game. A tournament concludes when
      its regulations state that it concludes. Additionally, if it has
      not previously concluded, a tournament concludes 3 months after
      its initiation.
      
      A Tournament is governed by a set of regulations, created in
      accordance with its parent rule, which have binding control over
      those who freely consent to oversee or participate in the
      tournament and over the tournament itself. When a tournament is
      initiated, its governing regulations are enacted. Once the
      tournament is concluded, these regulations cease to have any
      effect, and CAN be repealed by any player by announcement. A
      Tournament's regulations collectively have Mint Authority.
      
      Unless otherwise specified by the tournament's regulations, the
      gamemaster of a tournament is the person who initiated it.
      
      A tournament's regulations can provide for the enactment,
      amendment, and repeal of regulations for that tournament; if the
      regulations are silent, the gamemaster CAN, with 2 Agoran consent,
      enact, amend, or repeal such regulations. Any regulations so
      enacted are deemed to be regulations of the same tournament.
