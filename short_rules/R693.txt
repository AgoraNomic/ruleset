Rule 693/17 (Power=3)
Agoran Decisions

      When the rules call for an Agoran decision to be made, the
      decision-making process takes place in the following three
      stages, each described elsewhere:
      
      1. Initiation of the decision.
      
      2. Voting of the people.
      
      3. Resolution of the decision.
