Rule 2422/8 (Power=3)
Voting Strength

      The voting strength of an entity on an Agoran decision is an
      integer between 0 and 15 inclusive, defined by rules of power 2 or
      greater. If not otherwise specified, the voting strength of an
      entity on an Agoran decision is 3.
      
      When multiple rules set or modify an entity's voting strength on
      an Agoran decision, it shall be determined by first applying the
      rule(s) which set it to a specific value, using the ordinary
      precedence of rules, and then applying the rules, other than this
      one, which modify it, in numerical order by ID. Finally, if the
      result of the calculation is not an integer, it is rounded up, and
      then if it is outside the allowable range of values for voting
      strength, it is set to the minimum value if it was less and the
      maximum value if it was more.
