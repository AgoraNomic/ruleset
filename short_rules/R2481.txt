Rule 2481/9 (Power=3.1)
Festival Restrictions

      While Agora's Festivity is non-zero, the following apply:
      
      1. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, non-Festive players
         CANNOT support/be a supporter for tabled action intents;
      
      2. Quorum for Agoran Decisions is equal to half the number of
         Festive players, rounded up;
      
      3. Each Festive player has the maximum possible voting strength.
         Each person who is not a Festive player has the minimum
         possible voting strength. Rules to the contrary
         notwithstanding, no modifications to voting strength (other
         than defining the maximum and minimum) are applied by any other
         Rule.
      
      While Agora's Festivity is zero, the paragraphs above have no
      effect and are ignored.
