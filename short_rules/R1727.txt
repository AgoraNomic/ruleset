Rule 1727/21 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;
      
      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial Rulesets
      of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets of Nomic
      World and other nomics,
      
      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June 30,
      1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by FIRST SPEAKER
      Michael Norrish, which read, in part,
      
        "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
        precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think we may
        as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules are invited.
        In accordance with the rules, these will be published, numbered
        and distributed by me at my earliest convenience."
      
      And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic,
      known unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was played
      on, until its Players, much later, gave it its OFFICIAL NAME of
      Agora,
      
      And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest, and
      most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the hard work
      and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent advice of
      Agoraphobes,
      
      And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
      founding,
      
      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year.
