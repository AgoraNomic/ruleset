           IN CELEBRATION of Alexis being crowned Princess of Agora,
                without prejudice to Any before or since
                who may come to hold a Title
                whether Patent or otherwise;
          IT IS HEREBY PROCLAIMED that a Royal Parade be established,
                imbued in this very Rule,
                which shall travel around Agora to Rules of import;
          AND THEREFORE, the Rulekeepor SHOULD place this Rule
                near recently-amended rules of high Power;
          AND FURTHERMORE, additions to this Parade are most welcome
               when Events suiting the honour should occur.
          NEXT UP in the Parade comes the Discordian Court:  G. the
               Grand Vizier is arguing with Janet the Untitled, while
               nix, Court Anarchist, is cramming cancelled ballots into
               eir pockets.
