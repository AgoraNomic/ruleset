Rule 2152/11 (Power=3)
Mother, May I?

      The following terms are defined. These definitions are used when a
      rule includes a term in all caps, and provide guidance in
      determining the ordinary-language meaning of a term when a rule
      includes a term otherwise. Earlier definitions take precedence
      over later ones. If a rule specifies one or more persons in
      connection with a term, then the term applies only to the
      specified person(s).
