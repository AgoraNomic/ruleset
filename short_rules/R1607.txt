Rule 1607/60 (Power=3)
Distribution

      The Promotor is an office; its holder is responsible for receiving
      and distributing proposals.
      
      A referendum is the Agoran decision to determine whether to adopt
      a proposal (its associated proposal).  For this decision, the vote
      collector is the Assessor, the adoption index is initially the
      adoption index of the proposal, and the text, author, coauthors,
      and class of the proposal are essential parameters. Initiating a
      referendum is known as distribution, and removes the proposal from
      the Proposal Pool.
      
      The Promotor CAN distribute a proposal which is in the Proposal
      Pool at any time.
      
      In a given Agoran week, the Promotor SHALL distribute each
      proposal that was in the Proposal Pool at the beginning of that
      week, except for those excepted from automatic distribution by
      other rules, or those that are otherwise removed from the Pool. If
      there are ten or more undistributed proposals in the proposal
      pool, the Promotor MAY refrain from distributing the most recently
      added 5 proposals if e distributes each other proposal in that
      Agoran week.
      
      Distributed proposals have ID numbers, to be assigned by the
      Promotor.
      
      If there is a Proposal in the Pool that it would otherwise be
      IMPOSSIBLE for any player to distribute, then any player CAN
      distribute that Proposal without 3 objections.
      
      The Promotor's report includes a list of all proposals in the
      Proposal Pool, along with their text and attributes. This portion
      of a public document purporting to be a Promotor's report is
      self-ratifying.
      
      The destruction of a referendum is secured.
