Rule 1950/39 (Power=3)
Decisions with Adoption Indices

      Adoption index (AI) is an untracked switch possessed by Agoran
      decisions and proposals, secured at power 2.  For decisions, the
      possible values are "none" (default) or integral multiples of 0.1
      from 1.0 to 9.9. For proposals, the possible values are integral
      multiples of 0.1 from 1.0 to 9.9 (default 1.0). 
      
      The adoption index of a referendum CANNOT be set or changed to
      "none" or to a value less than that of its associated proposal. If
      a referendum ever has an adoption index of "none" or an adoption
      index less than that of its associated proposal, it is immediately
      set to the adoption index of the associated proposal.
      
      Adoption index is an essential parameter of an Agoran decision if
      that decision has an adoption index.
      
      For any Agoran decision with a non-"none" adoption index, the
      voting method is AI-majority.
