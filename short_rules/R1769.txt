Rule 1769/15 (Power=3)
Holidays

      The period each year from midnight GMT on the morning of 24
      December to the beginning of the first Agoran week to begin after
      2 January is a Holiday.
      
      The week that contains the beginning of Agora's Birthday,
      together with the following week, is a Holiday.
      
      If a person breaks a Rule by missing a deadline that occurs during
      a Holiday, punishment is generally not appropriate.
