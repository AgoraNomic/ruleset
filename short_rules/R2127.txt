Rule 2127/11 (Power=3)
Conditional Votes

      A conditional vote on an Agoran decision is a vote which indicates
      a vote based on some condition(s). A conditional vote is evaluated
      at the end of the voting period and, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, is clearly specified if and only if the value of
      the condition(s) is/are determinate at the end of the voting
      period. If the conditional is clearly specified, and evaluates to
      a valid vote, it is counted as that vote; otherwise, it is counted
      as PRESENT.
      
      Any vote which is clearly expressed as a conditional, e.g. "FOR if
      <X> is true, AGAINST otherwise", is a valid conditional vote that
      evaluates as specified.
      
      A vote endorsing another person is equivalent to a conditional
      vote evaluating to the vote specified in that person's valid
      ballot on the decision, if any.
      
      For an instant runoff decision, a vote consisting of a list, one
      or more entries of which are valid conditional votes, and the
      remaining entries of which are valid options, is a valid
      conditional vote. Such a vote is evaluated by evaluating each
      conditional entry to a list of votes (or an empty list, if it
      evaluates to PRESENT either directly or indirectly), and then
      concatenating those lists with the specified valid options in the
      order they occurred in the original vote.
