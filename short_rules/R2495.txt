The Birthday Tournament

      In a timely fashion after the start of June 1 of each year, the
      Herald SHALL propose a set of Regulations governing a Birthday
      Tournament for that year; the Herald CAN also delegate the
      responsibility for creating or running the tournament to another
      player, with that player's consent, by announcement.
      
      The Birthday Tournament's regulations SHOULD be such that all
      persons who choose to participate have a fair chance of winning
      the tournament (according to its regulations), and a winner
      SHOULD be expected within 2-3 weeks following the tournament's
      initiation.
      
      After adequate time for discussion of the Birthday Tournament's
      regulations, the Herald (or delegate) CAN initiate a sanctioned
      tournament, specifying a finalized set of governing regulations,
      without 3 objections. These regulations may thereafter be amended
      only by the Herald or eir designee Without 3 Objections. The
      initiation SHOULD be timed to coincide with Agora's Birthday.
