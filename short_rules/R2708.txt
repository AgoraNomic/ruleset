Rule 2708/1 (Power=1.0)
Crops

      Creating and destroying types of Crop is secured.
      
      Growing Season, Seed Cost, Growth Duration, and Sell Price are
      Crop type switches, tracked by the Land Managor, with these
      values:
      
      * Growing Season - all Crop Seasons
      * Seed Cost - integers from 50 to 200 inclusive, rounded
      * Growth Duration - integers from 3 to 24 inclusive, rounded
      * Sell Price - integers from 100 to 400, rounded
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a Crop type CANNOT be
      planted while its Seed Cost is null, and CANNOT be harvested while
      its Growth Duration or Sell Price is null.
      
      When rounding Seed Cost or Growth Duration, ties are broken toward
      the larger value.
      
      An in-season Crop is one whose Growth Season is in progress. All
      others are out-of-season.
