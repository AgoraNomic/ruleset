Rule 2708/0 (Power=1.0)
Crops

      Creating and destroying types of Crop is secured.
      
      Each type of Crop has an associated Crop Season, Seed Cost, Growth
      Duration, and Sell Price. Actions involving any of these
      attributes use the attribute values for the type of Crop involved
      in that action.
      
      An in-season Crop is one whose Crop Season is in progress. All
      others are out-of-season.
