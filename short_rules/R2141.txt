Rule 2141/16 (Power=3.2)
Role and Attributes of Rules

      A rule is a type of instrument that is always taking effect and
      has the capacity to govern the game generally. A rule's content
      takes the form of a text, and is unlimited in scope. The ruleset
      is the set of all currently-existing rules.
      
      Every current rule has power between 0.1 and 4.0 inclusive.
      
      Every rule shall have an ID number, distinct among current and
      former rules, to be assigned once by the Rulekeepor by public
      designation.
      
      Every rule shall have a title to aid in identification. If a rule
      ever does not have a title, then the Rulekeepor CAN and SHALL
      assign a title to it by announcement in a timely fashion.
      
      For the purposes of rules governing modification of instruments,
      the text, power, ID number, and title of a rule are all
      substantive aspects of the rule. However, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the Rulekeepor CAN set rule aspects as described
      elsewhere in this rule.
