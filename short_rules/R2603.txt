Rule 2603/2 (Power=1)
Default Recordkeepors

      For each type of switch or asset that is not defined as untracked
      and that has at least one instance that would otherwise lack a
      recordkeepor, there exists an imposed office named "Tracker of
      [type name]" whose holder tracks those instances.
