Rule 879/40 (Power=3)
Quorum

      Each Agoran decision has a quorum. This is a number set when the
      decision is created, and thereafter cannot be changed. When a
      person initiates an Agoran decision, that person SHALL state the
      quorum of that decision. However, incorrectly stating the quorum
      of a decision does not invalidate the initiation, nor does it
      actually change the quorum of the decision.
      
      The quorum that an Agoran decision gains as it is created can be
      defined by other rules of power 2 or greater. If no other rule
      defines the quorum of an Agoran decision, the quorum for that
      decision is equal to 2/3 of the number of voters on the referendum
      that had been most recently resolved at the time of that
      decision's initiation, the whole rounded to the nearest integer.
      
      As an exception to the previous paragraph, the minimum quorum of
      an Agoran decision is 2, or 1 if there are fewer than 2 players in
      the game. If the rules would attempt to set the quorum of an
      Agoran decision to less than the minimum quorum, it is set to the
      minimum instead.
