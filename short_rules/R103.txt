Rule 103/31 (Power=2)
The Speaker

      The Speaker is an imposed office and the figurehead leader of
      Agora. The player or players who have most recently won the game
      are called Laureled. If at any time the office of Speaker is
      vacant, or when one or more players win Agora, then the Prime
      Minister CAN once appoint a Laureled player to the office of
      Speaker by announcement.
      
      Whenever the Prime Minister CAN appoint a Laureled player to the
      office of Speaker, e SHALL do so in a timely fashion, except that
      the Prime Minister MAY defer appointing a new Speaker while there
      is pending one or more open CFJs that could plausibly determine or
      affect the question of whether a player is Laureled.  If the Prime
      Minister is emself Laureled, eir power to appoint a Speaker
      continues for the entirety of a message in which e resigns as
      Prime Minister, and if e is the only Laureled player, e CAN void
      that power, and thereby discharge the obligation to use it, by
      announcing that e declines to take the office.
      
      If the office of Speaker has been held continuously by the same
      person for the past 90+ days, then any player CAN appoint another
      player to the office with support.
