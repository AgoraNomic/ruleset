Rule 2231/7 (Power=3)
Order of the Hero of Agora Nomic

      Heroic titles are Agora's premier patent titles of distinction,
      and CAN be awarded to persons for meritorious service only by a
      proposal of power 3 or greater, which SHOULD explain why those
      persons are qualified. Bearers of heroic titles (Heroes)
      constitute the Order of the Hero of Agora Nomic.
      
      The Heroic titles in decreasing precedence are:
      
      Grand Hero of Agora Nomic (GHAN) -- This title may be awarded to
      any person obviously and directly responsible for the existence of
      Agora and/or Nomic in general. As this title is the highest honour
      that Agora may bestow, a Bearer of this title OUGHT to be treated
      right good forever.
      
      Hero of Agora Nomic (HAN) -- This title may be awarded to any
      person for outstanding meritorious service to Agora above and
      beyond the call of duty.
