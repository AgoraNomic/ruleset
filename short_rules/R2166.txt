Rule 2166/32 (Power=3)
Assets

      An asset is an entity defined as such by a document that has been
      granted Mint Authority by the Rules (hereafter the asset's backing
      document), and existing solely because its backing document
      defines its existence. An asset's backing document can generally
      specify when and how that asset is created, destroyed, and
      transferred.
      
      The rules collectively have Mint Authority. Contracts have Mint
      Authority. An asset defined by rule or regulation is public; any
      other asset is private.
