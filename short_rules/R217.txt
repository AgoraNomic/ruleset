Rule 217/12 (Power=3)
Interpreting the Rules

      When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
      takes precedence. Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
      unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense, past
      judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the game.
      
      Definitions and prescriptions in the rules are only to be applied
      using direct, forward reasoning; in particular, an absurdity that
      can be concluded from the assumption that a statement about
      rule-defined concepts is false does not constitute proof that it
      is true. Definitions in lower-powered Rules do not overrule
      common-sense interpretations or common definitions of terms in
      higher-powered rules, but may constructively make reasonable
      clarifications to those definitions. For this purpose, a
      clarification is reasonable if and only if it adds detail without
      changing the underlying general meaning of the term and without
      causing the higher powered rule to be read in a way inconsistent
      with its text.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any rule change that would
      (1) prevent a person from initiating a formal process to resolve
      matters of controversy, in the reasonable expectation that the
      controversy will thereby be resolved; or (2) prevent a person from
      causing formal reconsideration of any judicial determination that
      e should be punished, is wholly void and without effect.
