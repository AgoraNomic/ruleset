Rule 2140/5 (Power=3)
Power Controls Mutability

      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no entity with power below
      the power of this rule can
      
      1. cause an entity to have power greater than its own.
      
      2. adjust the power of an instrument with power greater than its
      own.
      
      3. set or modify any other substantive aspect of an instrument
      with power greater than its own (that is, one that affects the
      instrument's operation).
