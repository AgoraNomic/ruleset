Rule 2518/2 (Power=3)
Determinacy

      If a value cannot be reasonably determined (without circularity or
      paradox) from information reasonably available, or if it
      alternates indefinitely between values, then the value is
      considered to be indeterminate, otherwise it is determinate.
      
      A communication purporting to express conditional intent to
      perform an action is considered unclear and ambiguous unless, at a
      minimum, the conditional is determinate, true, and reasonably
      straightforward to evaluate with publicly-available information at
      the time of communication. The communicator SHOULD explain
      specific reasons for being uncertain of the outcome when e makes
      the communication.
