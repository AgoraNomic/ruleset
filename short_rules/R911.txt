Rule 911/56 (Power=1.7)
Motions and Moots

      The judge of a CFJ CAN by announcement self-file a Motion to
      Reconsider it, if its most recent judgement has been in effect for
      less than seven days.
      
      Any player CAN with 2 support group-file a Motion to Reconsider a
      case, if its most recent judgement had been in effect for less
      than seven days at the time the intent was tabled.
      
      The above notwithstanding, it is IMPOSSIBLE to file a Motion to
      Reconsider a CFJ whose current judgement has been entered into
      Moot, or that has already had a Motion to Reconsider filed against
      it by the same method since it was most recently assigned to a
      judge.
      
      When a Motion to Reconsider a case is filed, the case is rendered
      open again.
      
      If a CFJ has a judgement assigned, a player CAN enter that
      judgement into Moot with N+2 support, where N is the number of
      weeks from the time the judgement was assigned to the time the
      intent was tabled, rounded down. When this occurs, the CFJ is
      suspended, and the Arbitor is once authorized to initiate the
      Agoran decision to determine public confidence in the judgement,
      which e SHALL do in a timely fashion.
      
      For this decision, the vote collector is the Arbitor and the valid
      options are AFFIRM, REMAND, and REMIT. When the decision is
      resolved, the effect depends on the outcome:
      
      - AFFIRM, FAILED QUORUM: The judgement is reassigned to the case,
        and cannot be entered into Moot again.
      
      - REMAND: The case becomes open again.
      
      - REMIT: The case becomes open again, and the current judge is
        recused. The Arbitor SHALL NOT assign em to the case again
        unless no other eligible judges have displayed interest in
        judging.
