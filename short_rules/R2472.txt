Rule 2472/5 (Power=2)
Office Incompatibilities

      Some pairs of office are incompatible:
      
      1. Prime Minister and Speaker
      
      2. Promotor and Assessor
      
      3. Assessor and ADoP
      
      4. Referee and Arbitor
      
      A player is Overpowered if e holds two offices which are
      incompatible with each other. Rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, a player CANNOT be installed into an office if
      doing so would make em Overpowered.
      
      If a player is Overpowered, any player CAN, with Notice, Demand
      Resignation from em. When this occurs, each office that the
      Overpowered player holds becomes vacant.
