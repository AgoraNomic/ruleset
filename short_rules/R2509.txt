Rule 2509/3 (Power=2)
Agoran Numbers

      A "number" is considered to refer to a real number, unless
      otherwise explicitly specified.  A "number of (items)", where
      (items) is a set of discrete entities, is considered to refer to a
      non-negative integer, unless otherwise explicitly specified.
      
      If a switch is defined as being associated with a specified set of
      numbers (a numerical switch), then the possible values for that
      switch are the numbers in that set. In particular, a natural or
      integer switch is a switch with possible values the non-negative
      integers or all integers, respectively. If a limit is further
      defined, the possible values are the numbers of the set within the
      specified limits.
      
      If the rules describe mathematical operations to be used in
      flipping an instance of a numerical switch, the operations are
      interpreted as having common-sense mathematical application to
      determine that instance's resulting value. For example,
      "increasing a switch instance by M" is equivalent to "flipping a
      switch instance from its current value N to the value N+M". If the
      specified mathematical operation would result in a value outside
      that switch's defined set, the flipping CANNOT be performed, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.
