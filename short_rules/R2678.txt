Rule 2678/1 (Power=3)
Expectations of Participation

      An "Agoran forum" is a forum with publicity of discussion or
      public. Players of Agora have the following expectations of Agoran
      fora:
      
      * Agoran fora allow equal participation for all players, subject
        to the rules of Agora and the explicitly stated rules of the
        fora.
      
      * The rules of participation in public fora are as closely aligned
        with the rules of Agora itself as possible; a player expects to
        be able to fully participate in all public fora as long as eir
        participation is in line with Agora's rules.
      
      * Agoran fora allow all interested persons, even those that are
        otherwise restricted in eir participation, to read all messages.
      
      * Discussion fora moderators may restrict participation subject to
        eir own clearly stated rules but should only do so to players
        temporarily and proportional to the harm of the rule breakage.
      
      * The content of discussion fora should primarily be about Agora
        itself, or reasonably adjacent topics.
      
      If an existing Agoran forum is in violation of these expectations,
      the Agoran community, led by the Registrar, SHOULD remove it or
      replace it with an appropriate forum as soon as possible.
