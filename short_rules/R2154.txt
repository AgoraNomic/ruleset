Rule 2154/61 (Power=2)
Election Procedure

      When an election is initiated, it enters the nomination period,
      which lasts for 4 days. After an election is initiated and until
      nominations close, any player CAN become a candidate by
      announcement. A candidate ceases to be a candidate if e ceases to
      be a player during the election or if holding the office would
      make em Overpowered. During the nomination period, a candidate CAN
      cease to be a candidate by announcement if there is at least one
      other candidate.
      
      Each candidate in an election is ENCOURAGED to campaign by
      indicating why e would be the best choice, and (if applicable) how
      e would run the office differently than the previous holder.  The
      ADoP SHOULD remind candidates to campaign.
      
      An election whose nomination period is complete is contested if it
      has two or more candidates, and uncontested otherwise. Nominations
      close at the end of the poll's voting period or when the election
      is ended, whichever comes first.
      
      After the nomination period ends, the ADoP (or, if the office is
      the ADoP, the Assessor) CAN and, in a timely fashion, SHALL:
      
      1) If the election is contested, initiate an Agoran decision to
         select the winner of the election (the poll). For this
         decision, the Vote Collector is the ADoP (or, if the office is
         the ADoP, the Assessor), the valid options are the candidates
         for that election (including those who become candidates after
         its initiation), and the voting method is instant runoff. When
         the poll is resolved, its outcome, if a player, wins the
         election. If the outcome is not a player, the election ends
         with no winner.
      
      2) If POSSIBLE per the following paragraph, end the election
         immediately.
      
      If at any point an uncontested election has a single candidate,
      then any player CAN by announcement declare em the winner of the
      election, thereby causing em to win the election. If at any point
      an uncontested election has no candidates, then any player CAN
      declare the election ended with no winner by announcement.
      
      When a player wins an election, e is installed into the associated
      office and the election ends.
