Rule 2698/0 (Power=3.0)
Recordkeepors

      For some entity or class of entities to be "tracked by" another
      entity is for the latter entity to be its recordkeepor.
      
      For an entity to be a recordkeepor for a type of switch is for
      that entity to be the recordkeepor for all instances of that
      switch.
      
      Where the rules specify a recordkeepor for some set of instances
      of a switch, that recordkeepor's (weekly, if not specified
      otherwise) report includes the value of each instance in that set
      whose value is not its default value; a public document purporting
      to be this portion of that recordkeepor's report is
      self-ratifying, and implies that other instances in that set are
      at their default value.
      
      The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity (if any)
      defined as such by, and bound by, its backing document. That
      recordkeepor's report includes a list of all instances of that
      class and their owners. A public document purporting to be this
      portion of that recordkeepor's report is self-ratifying.
