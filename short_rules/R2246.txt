Rule 2246/7 (Power=2)
Submitting a CFJ to the Referee

      When a person initiates a Call for Judgement, e CAN, optionally,
      submit it to the Referee by announcement. All persons are
      ENCOURAGED to submit a case to the Referee only when there is a
      good reason not to let it be processed by the Arbitor as usual.
      
      When a CFJ is submitted to the Referee, the Referee receives all
      obligations and powers, other than obligations to report, for that
      case that the Arbitor would otherwise receive due to being
      Arbitor. This rule takes precedence over Rules that would
      otherwise assign duties and powers regarding to a judicial case to
      the Arbitor.
