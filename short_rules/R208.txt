Rule 208/14 (Power=3)
Resolving Agoran Decisions

      The vote collector for an unresolved Agoran decision CAN resolve
      it by announcement, indicating the outcome. If it was required to
      be initiated, then e SHALL resolve it in a timely fashion after
      the end of the voting period. To be EFFECTIVE, such an attempt
      must satisfy the following conditions:
      
      1. It is published after the voting period has ended.
      
      2. It clearly identifies the matter to be resolved.
      
      3. It specifies the number of voters (or a list of the voters).
         For these purposes and for determining quorum, a "voter" is
         someone who submitted a ballot on the decision that was valid
         when it was submitted and also valid (i.e. not withdrawn or
         otherwise invalidated) at the end of the voting period.
      
      4. It specifies the outcome, as described elsewhere, and, if there
         was more than one valid option, provides a tally of the voters'
         valid ballots.
      
      Each Agoran decision has exactly one vote collector, defaulting to
      the initiator of the decision. If the vote collector is defined by
      reference to a position (or, in the default case, if the initiator
      was so defined), then the vote collector is the current holder of
      that position.
      
      This rule takes precedence over any rule that would provide
      another mechanism by which an Agoran decision may be resolved.
      
      In general, changes to the gamestate due to the outcome of an
      Agoran decision take effect when the decision is resolved.
