Judicial Retraction and Excess

      A new case is a judicial case that has not had any judge assigned
      to it. The initiator of a new case CAN retract it by announcement,
      thus causing it to cease to be a judicial case.
      
      An excess case is a new case whose initiator previously initiated
      five or more cases during the same week as that case. A person

      judicial case. When e does so, e fulfills any obligations with
