Rule 2350/19 (Power=3)
Proposals

      A proposal is a type of entity consisting of a body of text and
      other attributes. A player CAN create (syn. submit) a proposal by
      announcement, specifying its text and optionally specifying any of
      the following attributes:
      
      * An associated title.
      
      * A list of coauthors (which must be persons other than the
        author).
      
      * An adoption index.
      
      Creating a proposal adds it to the Proposal Pool. Once a proposal
      is created, its text, author, and AI cannot be changed. The author
      (syn. proposer) of a proposal is the person who created it.
      
      The author of a proposal in the Proposal Pool CAN remove (syn.
      retract, withdraw) it from the Pool by announcement.
      
      The destruction of a proposal and the causing of a proposal to
      cease being a proposal are secured. The removal of a proposal from
      the Proposal Pool, other than by distribution, is secured.
