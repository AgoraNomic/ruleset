name: Interpreting the Rules
power: 3
text: |
  When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
  takes precedence. Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
  unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense, past
  judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the game.

  Definitions and prescriptions in the rules are only to be applied
  using direct, forward reasoning; in particular, an absurdity that
  can be concluded from the assumption that a statement about
  rule-defined concepts is false does not constitute proof that it
  is true. Definitions in lower-powered Rules do not overrule
  common-sense interpretations or common definitions of terms in
  higher-powered rules, but may constructively make reasonable
  clarifications to those definitions. For this purpose, a
  clarification is reasonable if and only if it adds detail without
  changing the underlying general meaning of the term and without
  causing the higher powered rule to be read in a way inconsistent
  with its text.

  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any rule change that would
  (1) prevent a person from initiating a formal process to resolve
  matters of controversy, in the reasonable expectation that the
  controversy will thereby be resolved; or (2) prevent a person from
  causing formal reconsideration of any judicial determination that
  e should be punished, is wholly void and without effect.
