  The Comptrollor is an imposed office.  When the office is vacant,
  the ADoP CAN, by announcement, set the Comptrollor to a player
  chosen at random from the set of current Officers, excepting any
  player who was most recently the Comptrollor.  The ADoP SHALL do
  so in a timely fashion after the office becomes vacant.

  When the Comptrollor office has been held for the same player for
  30 days, it becomes vacant.

  A Notice of Veto is a body of text, published by the Comptrollor,
  clearly, directly, and without obfuscation labelled within the
  publishing message as being a Notice of Veto.

  When a Comptrollor publishes a Notice of Veto, the office of
  Comptrollor becomes vacant.

  If the text of a Notice of Veto clearly indicates certain
  provisions within specified Proposals as being vetoed, and the
  voting period for a decision to adopt the proposal is ongoing
  when the Notice is published, then the provisions are vetoed. For
  the purposes of this Rule, each individual change specified within
  a proposal's text is a "provision".

  Vetoed provisions in a proposal are prohibited from being applied
  when the proposal takes effect (that is, that part of the
  proposal's effect CANNOT be applied).
