  During the nomination period of an election, any candidate for
  that election CAN submit a Campaign Proposal for that election,
  provided e does not currently have a pending Campaign Proposal for
  that election, using the normal mechanism for proposal submission.
  Campaign Proposals SHOULD relate to the duties of the office up
  for election. Commitment is an untracked Campaign Proposal switch
  with values Committed (default) and Uncommitted. The author of a
  Committed proposal may flip it to Uncommitted by announcement.

  A Campaign Proposal is an Official Proposal exempt from automatic
  distribution, and SHALL NOT be distributed except as required by
  the rules. The election with which a Campaign Proposal is
  associated, as well as its Commitment, are essential parameters
  for an Agoran decision to adopt a Campaign Proposal.

  When a Campaign Proposal is adopted, it CANNOT take effect until
  the associated election ends. When the election ends, if the
  winner was the proposal's author, then any player CAN once make it
  take effect by announcement (with its power set as usual for an
  adopted proposal). If the conditions for a Campaign Proposal to
  take effect are met as a result of an action in a public message,
  the author of the message SHALL make it take effect in that
  message.
