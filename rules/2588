  Sectors are entities; each Sector has an ID number, which is (the
  number of existent sectors that were created before it + 1).

  Creating, destroying or altering Sectors is secured.

  If no Spaceship is in a particular Sector, then that Sector is
  "empty"; otherwise it is "occupied".

  Two Sectors are "adjacent" if their IDs differ by exactly 1.
