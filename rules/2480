  Festivity is a singleton switch, whose possible values are
  integers ranging from 0 inclusive to the number of defined types
  of Ribbon exclusive, and defaulting to 0. While Agora's Festivity
  is 0, Festivity is tracked in the Tailor's monthly report.
  Otherwise, it is tracked in the Tailor's weekly report. Changes to
  Festivity are secured.

  If Agora's Festivity has had the same nonzero value for 14 days or
  more, any player CAN flip it to 0 by announcement.

  A player who owns at least N types of Ribbon CAN Start a Rank N
  Festival, where N is an integer greater than Agora's Festivity,
  with 4 Support from players who own at least N types of Ribbon.
  Upon doing so, Agora's Festivity is flipped to N. Exception: A
  player CANNOT do so if Agora's Festivity has had a value greater
  than or equal to N within the past 21 days.

  A person who owns a number of types of Ribbon equal to or greater
  than Agora's Festivity is known as Festive. Other persons are not
  Festive.
