  If the Rules associate payment of a set of assets (hereafter
  the fee for the action; syns: cost, price, charge) with performing
  an action, that action is a fee-based action.

  If the fee is a non-integer quantity of a fungible asset, the
  actual fee is the next highest integer amount of that asset.

  To perform a fee-based action, an entity (the Actor) who is
  otherwise permitted to perform the action must announce that e is
  performing the action; the announcement must specify the correct
  set of assets for the fee and indicate intent to pay that fee for
  the sole purpose of performing the action.

  Upon such an announcement:

    - If the Rules specify a recipient for the fee, and the Actor
      CAN transfer that specified fee from emself to the recipient,
      then that fee is transferred from the Actor to the recipient
      and the action is performed simultaneously;

    - If the Rules do not specify a recipient, and the Actor CAN
      destroy the specified fee in eir possession, then that fee in
      eir possession is destroyed and the action is performed
      simultaneously.

    - Otherwise, no changes are made to asset holdings and the
      action is not performed.

  If the Rules define a fee-based action but the specified set of
  assets is the empty set, then the action can be performed by
  announcement, but the announcement must include that there is an
  (empty or 0) fee for the action.
