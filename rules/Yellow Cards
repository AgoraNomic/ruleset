  A Yellow Card is a type of Card that is appropriate either for
  infractions that have a significant, though small, impact on
  gameplay or for infractions for which a Green Card has already
  been issued.

  When a Yellow Card is issued, the bad sport SHOULD publish a
  formal apology of at least 200 words explaining eir error,
  shame, remorse, and ardent desire for self-improvement. A player
  issuing a Yellow Card MAY, when doing so, additionally specify
  up to 10 words to be included in the apology. Until e publishes
  such an apology, as a penalty, the bad sport's voting strength
  on all Agoran decisions initiated within 30 days of the Card's
  issuance is set to 0 after modifiers.
