  A Yellow Card is a type of Card that is appropriate either for infractions
  that have a significant, though small, impact on gameplay or for
  infractions for which a Green Card has already been issued.

  When a Yellow Card is issued, the bad sport SHOULD publish a formal
  apology of at least 200 words explaining eir error, shame, remorse, and
  ardent desire for self-improvement. A player issuing a Yellow Card MAY,
  when doing so, additionally specify up to 10 words to be included in the
  apology. Until e publishes such an apology, as a penalty, the bad sport's
  voting strength on all Agoran decisions initiated within 30 days of the
  Card's issuance is set to 0 after modifiers.
