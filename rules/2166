  An asset is an entity defined as such by a (a) rule, (b)
  authorized regulation, (c) group of rules and/or authorized
  regulations (but if such regulations modify a preexisting asset
  class defined by a rule or another title of regulations, they must
  be authorized specifically to do so by their parent rule), or (d)
  contract (hereafter its backing document), and existing solely
  because its backing document defines its existence. An asset's
  backing document can specify when and how that asset is created,
  destroyed, and transferred.

  Each asset has exactly one owner. If an asset would otherwise lack
  an owner, it is owned by Agora. If an asset's backing document
  restricts its ownership to a class of entities, then that asset
  CANNOT be gained by or transferred to an entity outside that
  class, and is destroyed if it is owned by an entity outside that
  class (except if it is owned by Agora, in which case any player
  CAN transfer or destroy it without objection). The restrictions in
  the previous sentence are subject to modification by its backing
  document.

  Unless modified by an asset's backing document, ownership of an
  asset is restricted to Agora, players, and contracts. As an
  exception to the last sentence, non-player persons are generally
  able to own assets defined by a contract they are a party to,
  subject to modification by the contract in question.

  A contract's text can specify whether or not that contract is
  willing to receive assets or a class of assets. Generally, a
  contract CANNOT be given assets it is unwilling to receive. If the
  contract is silent on the matter, or if its willingness is
  indeterminate or the subject of a inextricable conditional, the
  procedure to determine its willingness is as follows:

    1. If the contract appears to anticipate being given assets,
       other than for sustenance (e.g. by authorizing parties to
       spend the contract's assets), then the contract is willing to
       receive all assets.

    2. Otherwise, it is unwilling to receive all assets.

  The previous paragraph (including the list) notwithstanding, a
  contract CAN be given 1 shiny a month for its sustenance payment,
  so long as it never has more than 1 shiny at a time.

  The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity (if any)
  defined as such by, and bound by, its backing document. That
  entity's report includes a list of all instances of that class and
  their owners. This portion of that entity's report is
  self-ratifying. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a contract
  CANNOT oblige a person who isn't a member to record its internal
  state, nor is the default recordkeepor responsible for tracking a
  contract's internal state. For the purposes of this rule, the
  promulgator of a regulation is bound by it.

  An asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner by announcement,
  subject to modification by its backing document. An indestructible
  asset is one defined as such by it backing document, and CANNOT be
  destroyed except by a rule, other than this one, specifically
  addressing the destruction of indestructible assets or that asset
  in particular; any other asset is destructible. In circumstances
  where another asset would be destroyed, an indestructible asset is
  generally transferred to Agora, subject to modification by its
  backing document and the intervention of other rules.

  To "lose" an asset is to have it destroyed from one's possession;
  to "revoke" an asset from an entity is to destroy it from that
  entity's possession.

  An asset generally CAN be transferred (syn. paid, given) by
  announcement by its owner to another entity, subject to
  modification by its backing document. A fixed asset is one defined
  as such by its backing document, and CANNOT be transferred; any
  other asset is liquid.

  When a rule indicates transferring an amount that is not a natural
  number, the specified amount is rounded up to the nearest natural
  number.

  A currency is a class of asset defined as such by its backing
  document. Instances of a currency with the same owner are
  fungible.

  The "x balance of an entity", where x is a currency, is the number
  of x that entity possesses. If a rule, proposal, or other
  competent authority attempts to increase or decrease the balance
  of an entity without specifying a source or destination, then the
  currency is created or destroyed as needed.

  When a player causes one or more balances to change, e is
  ENCOURAGED to specify the resulting balance(s). Players SHOULD NOT
  specify inaccurate balances.

  Where it resolves ambiguity, the asset or currency being referred
  to is the currency designated as "Agora's official currency", if
  there is one.

  An asset or class of assets is private, rather than public, if its
  backing document is a contract.

    When the rules require a payment of a number of assets, a number
    of small payments summing to the total do not fulfill the
    requirement.
