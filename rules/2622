  Pended is an untracked negative boolean proposal switch. Any
  player CAN pay 1 Pendant to flip the Pended switch of a specified
  proposal to True. If the player did not create the proposal and is
  not listed in the list of co-authors of the proposal, e is added
  to the list of co-authors.

  The Promotor CAN, once a week and with 2 support, flip the Pended
  switch of a proposal in the Proposal Pool to True. E SHOULD NOT do
  so if the author of the proposal has at least one Pendant or
  Legislative Card.

  A proposal with a Pended switch set to True is 'pending'.
