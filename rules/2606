  Proposals created since the enactment of this rule have an
  untracked Class switch with possible values ordinary (the default)
  and democratic.

  When a proposal with an adoption index greater than 2.0 is
  created, its class becomes democratic.

  Any player CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, flip an ordinary proposal's
  class to democratic, provided that it is in the Proposal Pool or
  that there is an Agoran decision on its adoption whose voting
  period has not yet ended.
