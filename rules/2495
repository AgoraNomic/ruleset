  In a timely fashion after the start of June 1 of each year, the
  Herald SHALL propose a set of Regulations governing a Birthday
  Tournament for that year; the Herald CAN also delegate the
  responsibility for creating or running the tournament to another
  player, with that player's consent, by announcement.

  The Birthday Tournament's regulations SHOULD be such that all
  persons who choose to participate have a fair chance of winning
  the tournament (according to its regulations), and a winner
  SHOULD be expected within 2-3 weeks following the tournament's
  initiation.

  After adequate time for discussion of the Birthday Tournament's
  regulations, the Herald (or delegate) CAN initiate a sanctioned
  tournament, promulgating a specified, finalized set of tournament
  regulations, without 3 objections. This title may thereafter
  be amended only by the Herald or eir designee Without 3
  Objections. The initiation SHOULD be timed to coincide
  with Agora's Birthday.
