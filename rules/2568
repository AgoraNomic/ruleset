  A facility's Allowed Land Types is a switch with allowed values of
  a list of allowed values of the Land Type switch, with a default
  value of {"Black", "White"}. A facility may not have a Parent Land
  Unit whose Land Type is not an element of their Allowed Land
  Types. If an action or set of actions would cause a facility to be
  created with a Parent Land Unit whose Land Type is not an element
  of its Allowed Land Types, that action or set of actions fails. If
  a facility's Parent Land Unit's Land Type is flipped to a color
  that is not in that facility's Allowed Land Types, that facility
  is destroyed.

  An “x facility”, where x is a Land Type or list of Land Types,
  refers to a facility that has the Allowed Land Types switch set to
  x.
