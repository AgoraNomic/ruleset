  Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously by
  the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part of
  it, e may submit a document to the Registrar, clearly labeled a
  Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and expressing eir
  reproach for those who e feels have treated em so badly.

  In a timely fashion after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the
  Registrar shall publish this document along with a Writ of
  Fugiendae Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione, commanding the Player
  to be deregistered. The Registrar shall note the method of
  deregistration for that Player in subsequent Registrar Reports.

  The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and the
  notation in the Registrar's Report will ensure that, henceforth,
  all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of FAGE.

    A document which is labeled as a Cantus Cygneus but does not
    actually detail grievances, etc. is not a Cantus Cygneus.
