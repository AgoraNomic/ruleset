    A judge may recuse emself from a CFJ they are assigned to.

    When a judge recuses emself from a CFJ the following happens:
      1 - The CFJ becomes unassigned
      2 - The recused judge becomes ineligible to be assigned as a judge
          for a week.
      3 - The recused judge SHOULD suggest another judge for the CFJ to
          make the Arbitor's job easier.
