  A rule which purports to allow a person (a deputy) to perform an
  action via normal deputisation or special deputisation for an
  office thereby allows them to perform the action as if e held
  the office, as long as

    1. it would be POSSIBLE for the deputy to perform the action,
       other than by deputisation, if e held the office, and

    2. Either (i) A time limit by which the rules require the action to be
       performed has expired or (ii) the office is vacant.

  Only this rule may allow normal deputisation. Any rule may allow
  special deputisation.

  A player CAN perform an action as if e held a particular office,
  via normal deputisation, if all of the following are true:

    1. The rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of
       holding that office, to perform the action. This
       requirement is fulfilled by the deputy performing the
       action.

    2. A time limit by which the rules require the action to be
       performed has expired.

    3. Either (i) the office is vacant; or (ii) the
       aforementioned time limit expired more than fourteen days
       ago; or (iii) the deputy announced between two and
       fourteen days earlier that e intended to deputise for that
       office for the purposes of the particular action.

  When a player deputises via normal deputisation for an elected
  office, e becomes the holder of that office.

  text: A requirement to perform an action, for the purposes of this rule, can be
    a logical implication from rules and circumstances, not just directly imposed
    by the rules. In particular, it is possible to deputise to rotate the bench.

  text: Deputisation is generally treated as if the deputy gained the office immediately
    before the action, and lost it immediately after.
