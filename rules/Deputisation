  A rule which purports to allow a person (a deputy) to perform an
  action via normal deputisation or special deputisation for an
  office thereby allows them to perform the action as if e held
  the office, as long as

    1. it would be POSSIBLE for the deputy to perform the action,
       other than by deputisation, if e held the office, and

    2. the deputy, when performing the action, announces that e
       is doing so by the appropriate form of deputisation.

  Only this rule may allow normal deputisation. Any rule may allow
  special deputisation.

  A player CAN perform an action as if e held a particular office,
  via normal deputisation, if all of the following are true:

    1. The rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of
       holding that office, to perform the action. This
       requirement is fulfilled by the deputy performing the
       action.

    2. A time limit by which the rules require the action to be
       performed has expired.

    3. Either (i) the office is vacant; or (ii) the
       aforementioned time limit expired more than fourteen days
       ago; or (iii) the deputy announced between two and
       fourteen days earlier that e intended to deputise for that
       office for the purposes of the particular action.

  When a player deputises via normal deputisation for an elected
  office, e becomes the holder of that office.

  text: A requirement to perform an action, for the purposes of this rule, can be
    a logical implication from rules and circumstances, not just directly imposed
    by the rules. In particular, it is possible to deputise to rotate the bench.

  text: Deputisation is generally treated as if the deputy gained the office immediately
    before the action, and lost it immediately after.
