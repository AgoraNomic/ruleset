  Each Auction has an Auctioneer.

  The Auctioneer of an Auction is the entity that initiates that
  Auction, and describes all of the specifics of an Auction. All
  rules or contracts permitting Auctions to be initiated should
  specify an entity to be Auctioneer. If no Auctioneer is specified,
  the default Auctioneer for Auctions defined by the rules is Agora,
  and the default Auctioneer for Auctions defined by a contract is
  the contract itself.

  A clause in a Contract purporting to make an entity which is
  neither the Contract itself nor a party to the Contract the
  Auctioneer of an Auction defined by that Contract is INEFFECTIVE.
