  Each Auction has an Auctioneer.

  The Auctioneer of an Auction is the entity that initiates that
  Auction, and describes all of the specifics of an Auction. All
  rules permitting Auctions to be initiated should specify an entity
  to be Auctioneer. If no Auctioneer is specified, the default
  Auctioneer for Auctions defined by the rules is Agora.
