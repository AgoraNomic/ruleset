  An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
  initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
  to initiate the decision.  This notice is invalid if it lacks
  any of the following information, and the lack is correctly
  identified within one week after the notice is published:

  1. The matter to be decided (for example, "the adoption of
     proposal 4781").

  2. A clear indication of the set of valid votes.

  3. The identity of the vote collector.

  4. Any additional information defined by the rules as essential
     parameters.

  The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting
  period for the decision.  The voting period lasts for 7 days.
  The minimum voting period for a decision with at least two
  options is five days.  The vote collector for a decision with
  less than two options CAN and SHALL end the voting period by
  announcement, if it has not ended already, and provided that e
  resolves the decision in the same message.

  The voting period for a decision cannot be set or changed to a
  duration longer than fourteen days.

  text: The intent to initiate the decision and the information required in the notice
    need not be explicit.

    called: 18 September 2007
  text: If the notice does not mention voter eligibility but the type of Agoran decision
    is clear and the rule defining the relevant type of Agoran decision fully determines
    the class of eligible voters, then the notice thereby implicitly describes the
    class of eligible voters.

    called: 15 August 2007
  text: Information that is explicitly presented in the notice takes precedence over
    any information that would be implicit, even where the explicit information is
    inaccurate and the implicit information would have been accurate.

  text: If a R107 notice initiating an Agoran decision does not contain an explicit
    list of the eligible voters, and there is later a dispute (evidenced by submission
    of a CFJ) over which voters were eligible at that time, then the notice's description
    of the class of eligible voters was necessarily insufficient to enable public
    agreement on which persons are eligible.

  text: The set of eligible voters on an Agoran decision can change during its voting
    period.
