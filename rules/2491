  At the start of each month, if Agora owns at least one Estate,
  then the Surveyor CAN and SHALL initiate an Estate Auction in a
  timely fashion.

  The Auctioneer of an Estate Auction is Agora. The Announcer of an
  Estate Auction is the Surveyor. The Starting Bid of an Estate
  Auction is 1 Shiny.

  An Estate Auction has one lot for each Estate owned by Agora,
  containing exactly and only that Estate. The Surveyor CAN freely
  determine the order in which those lots will be awarded.

  If an entity wins a lot in an Estate Auction, the Surveyor CAN,
  for each Estate in the lot, and at most once per Estate per Estate
  Auction, cause Agora to transfer each Estate to that entity.
