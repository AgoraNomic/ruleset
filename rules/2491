 At the start of each month, if Agora owns at least one Estate, the
 Surveyor CAN and SHALL put one Estate that is owned by Agora up for
 auction by announcement. Each auction ends seven days after it
 begins.

 During an auction, any player or contract may bid a number of
 Shinies by announcement, provided that the bid is higher than all
 previously-placed bids in the same auction.

 If, at the end of the auction, there is a single highest bid, then
 the player or contract who placed that bid wins the auction. The
 winner CAN cause Agora to transfer the auctioned Estate to emself
 by announcement, if e pays Agora the amount of the bid for the
 explicit and sole purpose of fulfilling this requirement. The
 person who placed the bid SHALL see to it that this is done in a
 timely fashion.
