  If nobody has done so in the previous 180 days, the Herald CAN
  initiate a Victory Election, a type of Agoran decision. On such
  a decision, all players are valid options; non-player persons
  can also become valid options during the voting period by
  announcement. The vote collector is the Herald, and the voting
  method is instant runoff.

  Upon the resolution of the decision, if the outcome is a person,
  then that person wins the game.
