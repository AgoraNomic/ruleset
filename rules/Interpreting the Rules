  When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
  takes precedence.  Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
  unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense,
  past judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the
  game.

  Definitions and prescriptions in the rules are only to be
  applied using direct, forward reasoning; in particular, an
  absurdity that can be concluded from the assumption that a
  statement about rule-defined concepts is false does not
  constitute proof that it is true.  Definitions in lower-powered
  Rules do not overrule common-sense interpretations or common
  definitions of terms in higher-powered rules.

  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any rule change that
  would (1) prevent a person from initiating a formal process to
  resolve matters of controversy, in the reasonable expectation
  that the controversy will thereby be resolved; or (2) prevent a
  person from causing formal reconsideration of any judicial
  determination that e should be punished, is wholly void and
  without effect.

    to take game actions by messages in languages other than English.
- cfjs:
  - id: '1460'
    called: 4 April 2003
  text: If a message is in a language other than English, and its intended audience
    does not understand the language, this constitutes gross unclarity that makes
    the message ineffective.

  text: Referring to a Player by a method other than eir name or nickname is acceptable,
    as long as it is unambiguous.

  text: A player's legal name (legal in eir country of residence) is not necessarily
    an acceptable way to refer to em.
- cfjs:
  - id: '1782'
    called: 4 November 2007
  text: Referring to a player by the name of an office that e holds suffices to identify
    em uniquely as a person, if there is no doubt regarding who holds that office.

  - id: '1460'
    called: 4 April 2003
  text: Extremely complex synonyms, requiring extensive effort to interpret correctly,
    can constitute a sufficient degree of unclarity as to render the message ineffective.

  text: A proper noun that has not been explicitly defined does not adequately refer
    to any entity, and is not implicitly defined by the context in which it is used.

  - id: '1580'
    called: 12 January 2006
  text: Base64 encoding of (part of) a message, other than in the context of MIME
    with appropriate headers, can render a message ineffective for unclarity, because
    the decoding step requires unreasonable effort within the meaning of CFJ 1460.
- cfjs:
  - id: '1741'
    called: 11 September 2007
  text: HTML encoding (including numerical character entity encoding) does not render
    a message ineffective for unclarity if a suitable MIME type is indicated by a
    header.
- cfjs:
  - id: '1741'
    called: 11 September 2007
  text: An email message does not need the RFC-required "MIME-Version:" header in
    order for it to be interpreted in the MIME way.
- cfjs:
  - id: '1536'
    called: 13 March 2005
  text: The phrase "AOL!" is not a sufficiently clear synonym for "Me too!".

  text: A contract can redefine a rule-defined term in its own way, and the contract's
    definition will then apply in situations governed by the contract.

  - id: '1885'
    called: 26 January 2008
  text: A word or phrase can acquire a meaning by custom, provided that it is a reasonable
    meaning and does not unreasonably change the meaning of phrases that already have
    a meaning.

  text: Mentioning a URI, without surrounding text stating its significance, does
    not incorporate anything identified by that URI into the message that mentions
    the URI.
- cfjs:
  - id: '1831'
    called: 10 December 2007
  text: Character sequences within a URI by default have no significance other than
    their functional role as part of the URI.

  text: Changes in whitespace are also inconsequential.
