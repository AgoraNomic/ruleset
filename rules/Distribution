  The Promotor is an office; its holder is responsible for receiving
  and distributing proposals.

  Determining whether to adopt a proposal is an Agoran decision. For
  this decision, the vote collector is the Assessor, the adoption
  index is initially the adoption index of the proposal, or 1.0 if
  the proposal does not have one, and the text, author, and
  coauthors of the proposal are essential parameters. Initiating
  such a decision is known as distribution, and removes the proposal
  from the Proposal Pool.

  The Promotor CAN distribute a proposal which is in the Proposal
  Pool at any time, by announcement. The Promotor SHALL NOT
  distribute proposals which are not pending.

  In a given Agoran week, the Promotor SHALL, as part of eir weekly
  duties, distribute all pending proposals except for those exempted
  from automatic distribution by other rules.

  Distributed proposals have ID numbers, to be assigned by the
  Promotor.

  If there is a Proposal in the Pool that it would otherwise be
  IMPOSSIBLE for any player to distribute, then any player CAN
  distribute that Proposal Without 3 Objections.

  The Promotor's report includes a list of all proposals in the
  Proposal Pool, along with their text and attributes. This portion
  of a public document purporting to be a Promotor's report is
  self-ratifying.

  text: If a proposal is purportedly distributed with a text that differs from the
    submitted text, this constitutes a legal distribution of the submitted proposal
    if and only if the difference does not affect the meaning of the proposal.

  text: Distributing a purported proposal whose text consists of the texts of two
    submitted proposals and separating matter from the message that submitted them
    both, if both submitted proposals have non-null effects, does not constitute a
    legal distribution of either of the submitted proposals.

  text: If the Promotor purports to distribute a proposal, but the distributed text
    does not match any proposal in the proposal pool, this constitutes the effective
    (albeit prohibited) distribution of a new proposal.

  text: If the Promotor creates a new proposal by distribution, by accidentally mangling
    the text of a proposal in the pool, and the new proposal is very similar in meaning
    to the one on which it is based (with only inconsequential differences), then
    the author of the new proposal is the author of the proposal on which it is based.

  text: If the Promotor accidentally creates a new proposal by distribution, and the
    new proposal is seriously different from any proposal in the pool, then the new
    proposal has no author.

  text: This rule defines a separate method of distribution from the one defined in
    Rule 107.
