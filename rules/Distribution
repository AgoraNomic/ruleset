text: "The Promotor is an office; its holder is responsible for\nreceiving and distributing
  proposals.\n\nDetermining whether to adopt a proposal is an Agoran decision.\nFor
  this decision, the vote collector is the Assessor, the\nadoption index is initially
  the adoption index of the proposal,\nor 1.0 if the proposal does not have one, and
  the text, author,\nand coauthors of the proposal are essential parameters. \nInitiating
  such a decision is known as distribution, and removes\nthe proposal from the Proposal
  Pool.\n\nThe Promotor CAN distribute a proposal which is in the Proposal\nPool at
  any time. The Promotor SHALL NOT distribute proposals\nwhich are not pending.\n\nIn
  a given Agoran week, the Promotor SHALL, as part of eir\nweekly duties, distribute
  all pending proposals.\n\nDistributed proposals have ID numbers, to be assigned
  by the\nPromotor.\n\nIf there is a Proposal in the Pool that it would otherwise
  be\nIMPOSSIBLE for any player to distribute, then any player CAN\ndistribute that
  Proposal Without 3 Objections.\n\nThe Promotor's report includes a list of all proposals
  in the\nProposal Pool, along with their text and attributes.  This\nportion of a
  public document purporting to be a Promotor's\nreport is self-ratifying.\n"

  text: If a proposal is purportedly distributed with a text that differs from the
    submitted text, this constitutes a legal distribution of the submitted proposal
    if and only if the difference does not affect the meaning of the proposal.

  text: Distributing a purported proposal whose text consists of the texts of two
    submitted proposals and separating matter from the message that submitted them
    both, if both submitted proposals have non-null effects, does not constitute a
    legal distribution of either of the submitted proposals.

  text: If the Promotor purports to distribute a proposal, but the distributed text
    does not match any proposal in the proposal pool, this constitutes the effective
    (albeit prohibited) distribution of a new proposal.

  text: If the Promotor creates a new proposal by distribution, by accidentally mangling
    the text of a proposal in the pool, and the new proposal is very similar in meaning
    to the one on which it is based (with only inconsequential differences), then
    the author of the new proposal is the author of the proposal on which it is based.

  text: If the Promotor accidentally creates a new proposal by distribution, and the
    new proposal is seriously different from any proposal in the pool, then the new
    proposal has no author.

  text: This rule defines a separate method of distribution from the one defined in
    Rule 107.
