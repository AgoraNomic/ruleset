      At the start of each month, if Agora owns at least one
      Estate, the Surveyor CAN and SHALL put one Estate that is owned by
      Agora up for auction by announcement. Each auction ends
      seven days after it begins.

      During an auction, any player or contract may bid a number of Shinies
      by announcement, provided that the bid is higher than all
      previously-placed bids in the same auction.

      If, at the end of the auction, there is a single highest bid,
      then the player or contract who placed that bid wins the auction.
      The winner CAN cause Agora to transfer the auctioned Estate to emself
      by announcement, if e pays Agora the amount of the bid for the explicit
      and sole purpose of fulfilling this requirement. The person who
      placed the bid SHALL see to it that this is done in a timely fashion.
