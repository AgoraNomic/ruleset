  For each person:

  1. If any task is defined by the rules as part of that person's
     weekly duties, then e SHALL perform it at least once each week.
     If any information is defined by the rules as part of that
     person's weekly report, then e SHALL maintain all such
     information, and the publication of all such information is
     part of eir weekly duties.

  2. If any task is defined by the rules as part of that person's
     monthly duties, then e SHALL perform it at least once each
     month. If any information is defined by the rules as part of
     that person's monthly report, then e SHALL maintain all such
     information, and the publication of all such information is
     part of eir monthly duties.

  Any information defined by the rules as part of a person's report,
  without specifying which one, is part of eir weekly report.
  Failure of a person to perform any duty required of em within the
  allotted time is the Class 2 Crime of Tardiness.

  An official duty for an office is any duty that the Rules
  specifically assign to that office's holder in particular
  (regardless of eir identity).

  Reports SHALL be published in plain text. Tabular data must line
  up properly when viewed in a monospaced font. Publishing a report
  that deviates from these restrictions is the Class 2 Crime of
  Making My Eyes Bleed.

  Officers SHOULD maintain a publicly visible copy of their reports
  on the World Wide Web, and they SHOULD publish the address of this
  copy along with their published reports.

  A convergence is any change to the gamestate that has, in
  accordance with the rules, been designated as such. A change to
  the gamestate SHOULD NOT be designated as a convergence unless it
  is designed to resolve gamestate ambiguity. Designating a change
  as a convergence is secured; any player CAN do so with 3 Agoran
  Consent. When officeholders provide historical information, they
  NEED NOT accurately document the changes made by the convergence
  or related ambiguities, provided that they instead note that the
  convergence occurred. Information about a convergence (but not the
  resulting state) is inherently uncertain and is thus excluded from
  self-ratification.
