  Any player can issue a Trust Token to another person by
  announcement.

  When the Assessor resolves a Decision to adopt a proposal, then
  any player who cast a valid vote on the Decision and was endorsed
  by another player's valid vote on the Decision is issued a Trust
  Token by the endorsing player.

  A person can win the game by announcement if e has been issued a
  Trust Token by each player except emself; if no person has won via
  this mechanism in the past; and if in the same message, e quotes,
  for each of those players, a public message in which that player
  issued em a Trust Token.
