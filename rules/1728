  an action by a set of one or more of the following methods (N is 1
  unless otherwise specified):

  1. Without N Objections, where N is a positive integer no greater
     than 8. ("Without Objection" is shorthand for this method with
     N = 1.)

  2. With N Supporters, where N is a positive integer. ("With
     Support" is shorthand for this method with N = 1.)

  3. With N Agoran Consent, where N is an integer multiple of 0.1
     with a minimum of 1.

  4. With Notice.

  5. With T Notice, where T is a time period.

  thereby allows em to perform the action by announcement if all of
  the following are true:

  1. A person (the initiator) announced intent to perform the
     action, unambiguously and clearly specifying the action and
     method(s) (including the value of N and/or T for each method),
     at most fourteen days earlier.

  2. If the action is to be performed Without N Objections, With N
     Agoran Consent, or With Notice, if the intent was announced at
     least 4 days earlier

  3. If the action is to be performed With T Notice, if the intent
     was announced at least T earlier.

  4. At least one of the following is true:

     1. The performer is the initiator.

     2. The initiator was authorized to perform the action due to
        holding a rule-defined position now held by the performer.

     3. The initiator is authorized to perform the action, the
        action depends on support, the performer has supported the
        intent, and the rule authorizing the performance does not
        explicitly prohibit supporters from performing it.

  5. Agora is Satisfied with the announced intent, as defined by
     other rules.

  6. If a set of conditions for the performance of the action was
     given in the announcement of intent to perform the action, all
     those conditions are met.

  The actor SHOULD publish a list of supporters if the action
  depends on support, and a list of objectors if it depends on
  objections.
