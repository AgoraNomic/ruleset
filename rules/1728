    The method of dependent action need not be described exactly: an
    approximate but inexact description suffices, as does the
    rule-defined term.

    The phrase "by Agoran Support" is not an unambiguous description
    of a method of dependent action.

    Dependent action intents aren't "by announcement" actions, so a
    message saying it a lot of times can be read "naturally" as
    counting as a single intent.
