  Imminence is a switch, tracked by the Promotor, possessed by
  proposals in the Proposal Pool, whose value is either "pending" or
  "not pending" (default).

  Any player CAN flip a specified proposal's imminence to "pending" by
  announcement by:

    a) spending 1 Action Point, OR

    b) spending 1/20th the Floating Value in shinies.
