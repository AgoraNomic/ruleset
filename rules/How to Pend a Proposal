  Imminence is a switch, tracked by the Promotor, possessed by
  proposals in the Proposal Pool, whose value is either "pending" or
  "not pending" (default).

  Any player CAN flip a specified proposal's imminence to "pending" by
  announcement by:

    a) spending 1 Action Point, OR

    b) spending the current Pend Cost in shinies.

  An Official Proposal is a proposal designated as such by the Rules; generally
  official proposals that are created as part of an Officer's duties. Rules to
  the contrary notwithstanding, an Official proposal is always pending. Rules
  to the contrary notwithstanding, players CANNOT claim rewards for the adoption
  of an Official proposal.
