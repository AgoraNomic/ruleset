  When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
  takes precedence.  Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
  unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense,
  past judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the
  game.

  Definitions and prescriptions in the rules are only to be
  applied using direct, forward reasoning; in particular, an
  absurdity that can be concluded from the assumption that a
  statement about rule-defined concepts is false does not
  constitute proof that it is true.  Definitions in lower-powered
  Rules do not overrule common-sense interpretations or common
  definitions of terms in higher-powered rules.

  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any rule change that
  would (1) prevent a person from initiating a formal process to
  resolve matters of controversy, in the reasonable expectation
  that the controversy will thereby be resolved; or (2) prevent a
  person from causing formal reconsideration of any judicial
  determination that e should be punished, is wholly void and
  without effect.
