name: Extending the voting period
power: 1
text: |
  Whenever the voting period of an Agoran decision would end, and
  the result would be FAILED QUORUM, the length of the voting period
  for that decision is instead increased to 14 days, except if it is
  already that length, provided this has not already happened for
  the decision in question.

  Upon such an occurrence, the vote collector for the decision SHALL
  issue a humiliating public reminder naming the slackers who have
  not yet cast any votes on it despite being eligible, and CAN end
  its voting period by announcement (resolving it constitutes an
  implicit announcement that its voting period is first ended) if
  the result would no longer be FAILED QUORUM, or if the decision is
  whether to adopt a proposal and no voter (other than possibly the
  proposal's author) has voted FOR.
