  An Agency is a document empowering persons to act on behalf of another
  player. A player MAY establish an Agency With 24 hours Notice, and thereby
  become its Director, by specifying the properties of the new Agency,
  provided e has not established any other Agency that day:

    1. A title, which must be exactly three words, not counting
       conjunctions, articles or prepositions.
    2. A non-empty list of persons other than the Director (the Agents).
    3. A description of a set of actions (the Powers).

  An Agency's Director may amend its properties or revoke it with 24 hours
  Notice. For greater certainty, an announced intent to create an Agency or
  amend an Agency's powers is INEFFECTIVE unless it explicitly specifies the
  new values of the properties being created or amended.

  The Powers of an Agency must be stated as actions, although they may
  be conditional on date, time, game state, or other preconditions. If
  condition(s) are specified as necessary for a power to be used, it is
  limited; otherwise, it is unlimited. If it attempts to specify a power in
  a manner that is unclear, ambiguous, circular, inconsistent, paradoxical,
  or that depends on information that is impossible or unreasonably
  difficult to determine, then the specification of that power is invalid,
  and it CANNOT be used.

  An Agency, once created, SHOULD be referred to by the acronym formed from
  its title with conjunctions, articles, and prepositions removed. The
  acronym of an agency must be unique and any attempt to create or amend an
  Agency such that two Agencies would have the same acronym is INEFFECTIVE.

  The Agents of an Agency may perform the Actions described in the Powers of
  the Agency on behalf of the Agency's Director.
