  Any organism that is generally capable of freely originating and
  communicating independent thoughts and ideas is a person. Rules to
  the contrary notwithstanding, no other entities are persons.

  Citizenship is a person switch with values Unregistered (default)
  and Registered, tracked by the Registrar. Changes to citizenship
  are secured. A registered person is a Player. To "register"
  someone is to flip that person's Citizenship switch from
  Unregistered to Registered.

  An Unregistered person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or
  prevented by the rules) register by publishing a message that
  indicates reasonably clearly and reasonably unambiguously that e
  intends to become a player at that time. A player CAN deregister
  (cease being a player) by announcement. If e does so, e CANNOT
  register or be registered for 30 days.

  A person, by registering, agrees to abide by the Rules. The Rules
  CANNOT otherwise bind a person to abide by any agreement without
  that person's willful consent.

  If a player has not sent a message to a public forum in the last
  month, then any player CAN deregister em with 3 Agoran Consent.

  The Rules CANNOT compel non-players to act without their express
  or reasonably implied consent. The rules CANNOT compel players to
  unduly harass non-players. A non-person CANNOT be a player, rules
  to the contrary notwithstanding.

    Any message expressing a clear desire or intent to register as a
    Player counts as a request for registration, whether or not it
    is explicitly phrased in the manner stipulated by the rules.

    Registering by publishing that you want to be a player is a
    different mechanism than registering "by announcement" and so
    gets around rules limitations on "registering by announcement".
