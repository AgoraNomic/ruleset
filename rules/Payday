  Payrate is an office switch, tracked by the ADoP, with a
  default value of 10 and possible values of positive integers.

  At the start of each month, if Agora's Balance is not 0 or
  less, Agora SHALL pay each player 10 shinies. Immediately
  afterward, if Agora's Balance is not 0 or less, Agora SHALL
  pay each player who holds an office the office's Payrate
  value, in ascending order of Payrate (breaking ties
  alphabetically by office) until all are paid or paying the
  next office would leave Agora's balance at 0 or less.
