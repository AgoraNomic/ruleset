  An Era is a period of time that has a defined start, either has a
  defined end or is still ongoing, and has been initiated as
  specified by this rule.

  Upon the initiation of an Era, each existing Ephemeral Rule (in
  the order they were created) is repealed, unless the initiation
  specifies otherwise.

  A player CAN initiate a new Era with Agoran Consent.
