name: Party Policy

  There are 5 Policies, in order:

  - Justice: interested in seeing justice served
  - Efficiency: interested in seeing official duties performed
  - Legislation: interested in seeing proposals passed
  - Participation: interested in seeing votes cast
  - Economy: interested in economic activity

  At any time, each Policy is held by exactly one Party. The
  assignments must be in cyclic order of their definitions, wrapping
  from bottom to top. For example, if the Platonic Isolationists
  hold Participation as their Policy, then the New Punchbowl
  Reformers hold Economy, the Costume Conservatives hold Justice,
  and so on.

  At the start of each Agoran month, the Planner CAN and SHALL, in a
  timely fashion, by announcement, select a new assignment of
  Policies to Parties (specifying the Policy of one Party is
  sufficient, since it implies the remainder). E CANNOT specify
  either of the assignments used in the previous two months.
