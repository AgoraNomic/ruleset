  Advisor is a Politician switch, tracked by the Clork, with
  possible values all players and none (default). For each
  Politician, Influence over <Politician> is a natural player
  switch, tracked by the Clork.

  A player CAN, by announcement, spend Favours in a Party to gain
  Influence over that Politican, depending on the Politician's
  Echelon:

  - Chamber of Power: 3 Favours for 2 Influence

  - Upper Echelon: 1 Favour for 1 Influence

  - Row Echelon: 2 Favours for 3 Influence

  - Row-Reduced Echelon: 1 Favour for 2 Influence

  If a player has more Influence over a given Politician than any
  other player, e can Advise that Politican by announcement. When e
  does so, if no other player Advises the same Politician later in
  the same Agoran week, then at the start of the next Agoran week,
  that player becomes that Politician's Advisor.
