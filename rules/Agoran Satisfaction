  A Supporter of a dependent action is an eligible entity who has publicly
  posted (and not withdrawn) support (syn. "consent") for an announcement of
  intent to perform the action. An Objector to a dependent action is an
  eligible entity who has publicly posted (and not withdrawn) an objection
  to the announcement of intent to perform the action.

  The entities eligible to support or object to a dependent action are, by
  default, all players, subject to modification by the document authorizing
  the dependent action. However, the previous sentence notwithstanding, the
  Executor of the announcement of intent is not eligible to support it.

  Agora is Satisfied with an intent to perform a specific action if and only
  if:

  1. if the action is to be performed Without N Objections, then it has
     fewer than N objectors;

  2. if the action is to be performed With N supporters, then it has N or
     more supporters; and

  3. if the action is to be performed with N Agoran Consent, then the ratio
     of supporters to objectors is greater than N, or the action has at
     least one supporter and no objectors.

  4. if the action is to be performed With Notice or With T Notice.

  The above notwithstanding, if the action depends on objections, and an
  objection to it has been withdrawn within the past 24 hours, then Agora is
  not Satisfied with the intent.

  The above notwithstanding, Agora is not satisfied with the intent if the
  Speaker has objected to it in the last 48 hours.

  A person CANNOT support or object to an announcement of intent before the
  intent is announced, or after e has withdrawn the same type of response.
