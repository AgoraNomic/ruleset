  An entity authorized by a rule or contract to initiate an Auction
  CAN do so by announcement. If the rule or contract specifies that
  that entity MUST do so, that entity SHALL do so in a timely
  fashion. An Auction CANNOT be initiated other than as described by
  a rule or contract.

  An Auction CANNOT be initiated unless the announcer specifies all
  of

  * the Auction's lots, in the order they will be awarded,

  * the items in each lot,

  * the Auction's Auctioneer,

  * the Auction's Announcer,

  * the Auction's minimum bid, and, optionally

  * the Auction's currency

  in the message initiating the Auction. An Auction also CANNOT be
  initiated unless the Auctioneer is able to give away each item in
  each of the Auction's lots.

  If no currency is specified, it defaults to Shinies.
