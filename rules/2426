  A Card is a recognition of a specific violation of the rules or
  other manner of infraction that is awarded to the violator in
  order to draw attention to eir disregard for the rule of law and,
  depending on the type of Card, to impose a penalty.

  Cards CANNOT be issued except by players by announcement. Any
  attempt to issue a Card, or any intent for a dependent action to
  issue a Card, is INEFFECTIVE if it does not include the following
  information:

  - The type of Card being issued,

  - The person to whom the Card is being issued (the bad sport), and

  - The specific action, inaction of the bad sport giving rise to
    the Card (the reason).

  Issuing Cards is secured with power threshold 1.7.

  The types of Card are defined by the rules. A type of Card may
  have a defined set of circumstances for which it is appropriate,
  as well as a penalty which takes effect when a Card of that type
  is issued. Unless otherwise specified by the rule defining a type
  of Card, that Card type's penalty and circumstances for which it
  is appropriate are secured at the power threshold of that rule. It
  is inappropriate to award a card to a non-player person unless the
  rule defining the card says otherwise.

  A person SHALL NOT issue a Card unless:

  - the reason is appropriate for the type of Card being issued;

  - there has not already been a Card issued for that reason; and

  - the reason occurred within the 14 days preceding the issuance of
    the Card or, when the Card arises out of any manner of official
    proceeding, the initiation of that proceeding.
