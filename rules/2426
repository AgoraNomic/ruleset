  A Card is a recognition of a specific violation of the rules or
  other manner of infraction that is awarded to the violator in
  order to draw attention to eir disregard for the rule of law and,
  depending on the type of Card, to impose a penalty.

  Cards CANNOT be issued except by players by announcement. Any
  attempt to issue a Card is INEFFECTIVE if it does not include (1)
  the type of card being issued, (2) the name of the person being
  issued the card (the bad sport), and (3) the specific reason for
  the issuance of the card, or if it attempts to issue a person a
  card for an action or inaction which e (more likely than not) did
  not commit, or if it attempts to issue a card for an action or
  inaction which is not prohibited by law, or if it attempts to
  issue a type of card which is blatantly and obviously unsuited to
  the conduct which constitutes the reason for its issuance or to
  the person to which it is being issued, or if it is made more than
  14 days after the conduct constituting the reason for the issuance
  of the card, or if it attempts to issue a card to a player who has
  already been issued a card for the conduct constituting the reason
  for the issuance of the card.

  Issuing Cards is secured with power threshold 1.7.

  The types of Card are defined by the rules. A type of Card may
  have a defined set of circumstances for which it is appropriate,
  as well as a penalty which takes effect when a Card of that type
  is issued. Unless otherwise specified by the rule defining a type
  of Card, that Card type's penalty and circumstances for which it
  is appropriate are secured at the power threshold of that rule. It
  is inappropriate to award a card to a non-player person unless the
  rule defining the card says otherwise.

  A person SHALL NOT issue a Card unless:

  - the reason is appropriate for the type of Card being issued;

  - there has not already been a Card issued for that reason; and
