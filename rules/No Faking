  A person SHALL NOT make a public statement that is a lie. A
  statment is a lie if its publisher either knew or believed it to
  be not to be true at the time e published it (or, in the case of
  an action, not to be effective), and it was made with the intent
  to mislead. Merely quoting a statement does not constitute making
  it for the purposes of this rule. Any disclaimer, conditional
  clause, or other qualifier attached to a statement constitutes
  part of the statement for the purposes of this rule; the truth or
  falsity of the whole is what is significant.

  The previous provisions of this rule notwithstanding, a formal
  announcement of intent is never a lie.
