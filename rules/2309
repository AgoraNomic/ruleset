  The Fearmongor is an Office. Its holder is responsible for
  ensuring the continuous change of the ruleset.

  Each month, the Fearmongor SHALL do the following as part of eir
  duties:

  1) Select two existing rules at random. For each of those rules,
     submit an Official proposal with AI equal to that rules' power.
     One proposal SHALL specify only to repeal its rule; the other
     SHALL specify only to amend its rule.

  3) Select a previous rule that was repealed over 1 year ago, and
     has not been so selected in the past 6 months. Submit an
     Official proposal of the appropriate AI to re-enact the rule at
     its previous power, using any past version of the rule as a
     basis and making minimal modifications to that text to allow
     the rule to function in the current ruleset.
