  The Tailor is an office, and the recordkeepor of Ribbons.

  Ribbon Ownership is a secured person switch, tracked by the
  Tailor in eir monthly report, whose values are the subsets of
  the set of types of Ribbon, defaulting to the empty set. If the
  rules are amended to change the types of Ribbon, if a player's
  Ribbon Ownership is subsequently illegal, then it is updated by
  removing all nonexistent types rather than resetting the entire
  value to default.

  To "award a person a <Ribbon type>" is to add that type of Ribbon
  to that person's Ribbon Ownership. A person "owns a <Ribbon type>"
  if that type of Ribbon is an element of eir Ribbon Ownership.

  A person qualifies for a type of Ribbon if e has earned that type
  of Ribbon within the preceding 7 days (including earlier in the
  same message).

  While a person owns all types of Ribbon, that person can Raise a
  Banner by announcement. This causes that person to win the game.
  That person's Ribbon Ownership becomes the empty set.

  The types of Ribbon, and the methods of obtaining them, are as
  follows:

  Red (R): When a proposal is adopted and changes at least one rule
  that, immediately before or after the change, has Power >= 3, its
  proposer earns a Red Ribbon.

  Orange (O): When a proposal is adopted via an Agoran Decision on
  which no valid ballots were AGAINST (after evaluating
  conditionals), its proposer earns an Orange Ribbon.

  Green (G): While a person holds an elected office, has done so
  continuously for the past 30 days, and has not failed to perform
  any duties of that office within the appropriate time limits
  during those 30 days, that person qualifies for a Green Ribbon.

  Emerald (E): When a person wins an election, e earns an Emerald Ribbon.

  Cyan (C): When a person deputises for an office, that person earns
  a Cyan Ribbon.

  Blue (B): When a person assigns a judgement to a CFJ, and has
  never violated a time limit to assign a judgement to that CFJ,
  that person earns a Blue Ribbon.

  Magenta (M): When, during Agora's Birthday, a person publicly
  acknowledges it, that person earns a Magenta Ribbon.

  Ultraviolet (U): When a person is awarded the Patent Title
  Champion, that person earns an Ultraviolet Ribbon.

  Violet (V): When a person is awarded a Patent Title other than
  Champion or a degree, that person earns a Violet Ribbon.

  Indigo (I): When a person is awarded a degree, that person earns
  an Indigo Ribbon.

  Platinum (P): The Speaker qualifies for a Platinum Ribbon.

  Lime (L): A person qualifies for a Lime Ribbon if three or more
  proposals adopted in the preceding 7 days had that person as a
  coauthor.

  White (W): A player qualifies for a White Ribbon if e has never
  previously owned a White Ribbon (including under previous
  rulesets). A player who has been registered for at least 30 days
  and has never acted on eir own behalf to cause another person to
  gain a White Ribbon (including under a previous ruleset) CAN act
  on eir own behalf to award a White Ribbon to another person by
  announcement.

  Black (K): This rule does not specify any methods of obtaining
  Black Ribbons.

  Gray (A): The Tailor CAN award a Gray Ribbon by announcement,
  unless e has done so earlier in the month. E is ENCOURAGED to
  award such a Ribbon in the same message in which e publishes eir
  monthly report.

  Transparent (T): A person qualifies for a Transparent Ribbon while
  the number of other types of Ribbon that that person qualifies
  for, earns, and/or was awarded within the previous 7 days is at
  least 5.
  
  While a person qualifies for a type of Ribbon:

    - If e has not owned that type of Ribbon within the preceding 7 days,
      any player CAN, by announcement, award em that type of Ribbon.

    - Otherwise, if e has not been awarded that type of Ribbon or the
      corresponding type of Glitter since e last earned or came to qualify
      for that type of Ribbon, e CAN, by announcement, award emself that
      type of Glitter.
