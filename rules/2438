  The Tailor is an office, and the recordkeepor of Ribbons.

  Ribbon Ownership is a person switch, tracked by the Tailor in eir
  monthly report, whose values are the subsets of the set of types
  of Ribbon, defaulting to the empty set. If the rules are amended
  to change the types of Ribbon, if a player's Ribbon Ownership is
  subsequently illegal, then it is updated by removing all
  nonexistent types rather than resetting the entire value to
  default.

  To "award a person a <Ribbon type>" is to add that type of Ribbon
  to that person's Ribbon Ownership. A person "owns a <Ribbon type>"
  if that type of Ribbon is an element of eir Ribbon Ownership.

  While a person qualifies for a type of Ribbon, any player CAN, by
  announcement, award em that type of Ribbon. A person qualifies for
  a type of Ribbon if e has earned that type of Ribbon within the
  preceding 7 days (including earlier in the same message) and has
  not owned that type of Ribbon within the preceding 7 days.

  While a person owns all types of Ribbon, that person can Raise a
  Banner by announcement. This causes that person to win the game.
  That person's Ribbon Ownership becomes the empty set.

  The types of Ribbon, and the methods of obtaining them, are as
  follows:

  Red (R): When a proposal is adopted and changes at least one rule
  with Power >= 3, its proposer earns a Red Ribbon.

  Orange (O): When a proposal is adopted via an Agoran Decision on
  which no valid ballots were AGAINST (after evaluating
  conditionals), its proposer earns an Orange Ribbon.

  Green (G): While a person has held an elected office continuously
  for 30 days, and has not failed to perform any duties of that
  office within the appropriate time limits during those 30 days,
  that person qualifies for a Green Ribbon.

  Cyan (C): When a person deputises for an office, that person earns
  a Cyan Ribbon.

  Blue (B): When a person assigns a judgement to a CFJ, and has
  never violated a time limit to assign a judgement to that CFJ,
  that person earns a Blue Ribbon.

  Magenta (M): During Agora's Birthday, each person who has publicly
  acknowledged the fact qualifies for a Magenta Ribbon.

  Ultraviolet (U): When a person is awarded the Patent Title
  Champion, that person earns an Ultraviolet Ribbon.

  Violet (V): When a person is awarded a Patent Title other than
  Champion or a degree, that person earns a Violet Ribbon.

  Indigo (I): When a person is awarded a degree, that person earns
  an Indigo Ribbon.

  Platinum (P): The Speaker qualifies for a Platinum Ribbon.

  Lime (L): A person qualifies for a Lime Ribbon if three or more
  proposals adopted in the preceding 7 days had that person as a
  coauthor.

  White (W): A player qualifies for a White Ribbon if e has never
  previously owned a White Ribbon (including under previous
  rulesets). A player who has been registered for at least 30 days
  and has never caused another person to gain a White Ribbon
  (including under a previous ruleset) CAN award a White Ribbon to
  another person by announcement.

  Black (K): This rule does not specify any methods of obtaining
  Black Ribbons.

  Gray (A): The Tailor CAN award a Gray Ribbon by announcement,
  unless e has done so earlier in the month. E is ENCOURAGED to
  award such a Ribbon in the same message in which e publishes eir
  monthly report.

  Transparent (T): A person qualifies for a Transparent Ribbon while
  the number of other types of Ribbon that that person qualifies for
  and/or has earned within the previous 7 days is at least 5.
