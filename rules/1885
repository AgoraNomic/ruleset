  Whenever a zombie (1) has Agora for a master, (2) an auction for
  it is not underway, and (3) has not been won as an auction lot in
  the past 14 days, then the Registrar CAN put that zombie (along
  with any other zombies that fulfill the same conditions) up for
  auction.

  In a timely fashion after the beginning of each month, the
  Registrar SHALL either initiate such an auction or, if no zombies
  meeting these conditions existed at the beginning of the month,
  announce that no such auction is necessary.

  For such an auction, the lots are the qualifying zombies, ordered
  at the discretion of the Registrar. The Registrar is the
  announcer, and the minimum bid is 1.

  The Registrar CAN flip the master switch of a zombie lot from
  Agora to that lot's winner after the winner has paid for the lot;
  for the purposes of the auction, to transfer a zombie to a player
  is to set that zombie's master switch to that player.
