  Whenever a zombie has Agora for a master and an auction for it is
  not underway or been won in the last seven days, then the
  Registrar CAN and SHALL, in a timely fashion, put the specified
  zombie up for auction by announcement. Each auction ends seven
  days after it begins.

  During an auction, any player who is not a zombie CAN bid a number
  of Shinies for the specified zombie by announcement.

  The winner of the auction, if any, is the player who bids the
  highest number of shinies, with ties broken in favor of the
  earlier bidder.  The winner CAN and SHALL, in a timely fashion,
  flip the zombie's master to the winner by announcement, if e pays
  Agora the amount of the bid for the explicit and sole purpose of
  fulfilling this requirement. If there are no bids, the auction has
  no winner.

  If a zombie being auctioned ceases to have Agora as a master at
  any time between the initiation of the auction and the winner
  becoming the zombie's master (or failing to do so in a timely
  fashion after the auction), then the auction has no winner, and
  any obligations to pay for the zombie are voided.
