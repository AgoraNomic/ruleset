  Any player CAN, without objection, ratify a public document,
  specifying its scope.

  Ratification Without Objection CANNOT cause the repeal, amendment,
  enactment, or mutation of any Rule, rules to the contrary
  notwithstanding.

  A player SHALL NOT knowingly use or announce intent to use
  Ratification Without Objection to ratify a (prior to ratification)
  document containing incorrect or Indeterminate information when a
  corrected document could be produced with reasonable effort,
  unless the general nature of the document's error and reason for
  ratifying it is clearly and plainly described in the announcement
  of intent. Such ratification or announcement of intent to ratify
  is the Class-8 Crime of Endorsing Forgery.

    Ratification of an official document affects only those aspects
    of gamestate that are defined to be part of the official report,
    and not aspects that are incidentally reported on; in
    particular, ratification of an official report on certain
    parameters pertaining to each player does not ratify the list of
    players.

    Ratification Without Objection of a value inseparable from
    another value may change the latter value even if it is not
    directly part of the report being ratified.
