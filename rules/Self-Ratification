  A public document defined by the rules as self-ratifying is
  ratified when it is continuously undoubted for one week.

  A doubt is an explicit public challenge via one of the following
  methods, identifying a document and explaining the scope and
  nature of a perceived error in it:

   1. An inquiry case, appropriate for questions of legal
      interpretation.

   2. A claim of error, appropriate for matters of fact.  The
      publisher of the original document SHALL (if e was required
      to publish that document) or SHOULD (otherwise) do one of
      the following in a timely fashion:

        1. Deny the claim (causing it to cease to be a doubt).
        2. Publish a revision.
        3. Initiate an inquiry case regarding the truth of the
           claim (if the subject is actually a matter of law),
           or cite a relevant existing inquiry case.

    of an Agoran decision} must explicitly identify the document, either individually
    or as part of a set, and explicitly contest the accuracy of some aspect of it.
