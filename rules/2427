  A Yellow Card is a type of Card that is appropriate either for
  infractions that have a significant, though small, impact on
  gameplay or for infractions for which a Green Card has already
  been issued.

  When a Yellow Card is issued, the bad sport SHOULD publish a
  formal apology of at least 200 words explaining eir error, shame,
  remorse, and ardent desire for self-improvement. A player issuing
  a Yellow Card MAY, when doing so, additionally specify up to 10
  words to be included in the apology. Until e publishes such an
  apology, as a penalty, the bad sport's voting strength on all
  Agoran decisions initiated within 30 days of the Card's issuance
  is set to 0 after modifiers.
