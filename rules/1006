  Officeholder is an office switch tracked by the ADoP, with
  possible values of any person or "vacant". An officer is the
  holder of an office, who may be referred to by the name of that
  office. If the holder of an office is ever not a player, it
  becomes vacant.

  An imposed office is an office described as such by the rule
  defining it. All others are elected. A person CANNOT be made the
  holder of an elected office without eir explicit or reasonably
  implied consent.

  A holder of an elected office who did not become its holder by
  winning an election, and has not won an election for that office
  since, is an interim holder. An elected office that is either
  vacant or has an interim holder is an interim office.

  The holder of an elected office CAN resign it by announcement,
  causing it to become vacant. The non-interim holder of an elected
  office CAN, With 3 Support, resign the office while appointing
  another player to become the holder of the office, provided that
  other player is one of the Supporters. Any player CAN cause an
  office to become vacant without 2 objections.

  When a proposal takes effect and creates a new office, if the
  proposal does not specify otherwise, the author of that proposal
  becomes the holder of the office.

    This rule does not define the meaning of the term "office", in the sense
    meant by Rule 754, but rather references the usual English
    definition of "office" and governs offices as thus defined.

    A requirement to submit something to an officer is satisfied by
    publishing it, even if that office is vacant at the time.
