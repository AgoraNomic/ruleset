  Each Agoran decision has a voting method, which determines how
  voters may vote on it and how to calculate the outcome. The
  strength of a ballot is the voting strength of the voter who cast
  it on that Agoran decision.

  1. For an AI-majority decision, let F be the total strength of all
     valid ballots cast FOR a decision, A be the same for AGAINST,
     and AI be the adoption index of the decision. The outcome is
     ADOPTED if F/A >= AI and F/A > 1 (or F>0 and A=0), otherwise
     REJECTED.

  2. For an instant runoff decision, the outcome is whichever option
     wins according to the standard definition of instant runoff.
     For this purpose, a ballot of strength N is treated as if it
     were N distinct ballots expressing the same preferences. In
     case multiple valid options tie for the lowest number of votes
     at any stage, the vote collector CAN and must, in the
     announcement of the decision's resolution, select one such
     option to eliminate; if, for M > 1, all eir possible choices in
     the next M stages would result in the same set of options being
     eliminated, e need not specify the order of elimination. If an
     entity that is part of a valid vote is not a valid option at
     the end of the voting period, or disqualified by the rule
     providing for the decision, then that entity is eliminated
     prior to the first round of counting.

  3. For a first-past-the-post decision, the outcome is whichever
     option received the highest total strength of valid ballots. In
     case of a tie, the vote collector CAN and must, in the
     announcement of the decision's resolution, select one of the
     leaders as the outcome.

  The previous notwithstanding:

  - If there is more than one option, and the number of valid
    ballots is less than the quorum of that decision, the outcome is
    instead FAILED QUORUM.

  - If there are no valid options, the outcome is null.

  The outcome of a decision is determined when it is resolved, and
  cannot change thereafter.
