- Created by Proposal 7815 (Alexis, aranea), 28 October 2016

  When a rule allows one person (the agent) to act on behalf of another (the
  principal) to perform an action, that agent CAN perform the action if it
  is POSSIBLE for the principal to do so, taking into account any
  prerequisites for the action. If the enabling rule does not specify the
  mechanism by which the agent may do so, then the agent CAN perform the
  action in the same manner in which the principal CAN do so, with the
  additional requirement that the agent must, in the message in which the
  action is performed, uniquely identify the principal and that the action
  is being taken on behalf of that person.

  When an action is performed on behalf of a principal, then the action is
  considered for all game purposes to have been performed by the principal.

  This rule takes precedence over any rule which would prohibit a person
  from taking an action, except that it defers to any rule that imposes
  limitations specifically on actions taken on behalf of another person.
