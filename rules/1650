  Each Agoran Week a Player is designated the Silly Person. The
  Silly Person SHALL in that week, by announcement (1) designate
  another player, who has not been the Silly Person in the past two
  weeks, to be the next week's Silly Person; (2) submit a Silly
  Proposal. If there is ever no Silly Person or the Silly Person is
  not a player, then the next week's Silly Person is the first
  player that any player publicly designates to be the next week's
  Silly Person.

  A Silly Proposal is a Proposal whose sole contents are one of
  the following:

  i) A limerick.

  ii) A poem with a rhyme scheme and/or strict metrical structure no
      longer than 14 lines (No free verse!)

  iii) A joke or truly hideous pun of no more than a two hundred
       words.

  The first Silly Proposal submitted by the week's Silly Person is
  an Official Proposal.
