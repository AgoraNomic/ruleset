  To “distribute” a quantity of a fungible asset to a set of
  recipients is to transfer one instance of that asset at a time to
  the recipient that owns the least number of instances of that
  asset, until either no more instances of the asset are eligible to
  be distributed, or the number of instances so transferred equals
  the quantity to be distributed. If, when distributing a specific
  asset, two or more recipients each own the least number of
  instances of that asset, then the recipient that most recently
  became eligible to own the asset SHALL receive the asset being
  distributed.
