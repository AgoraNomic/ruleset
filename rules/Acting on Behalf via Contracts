  If a rule says that a contract CAN do something by announcement, it is
  equivalent to saying that that any person CAN take that action by announcement
  if the contract's text says that e CAN do so under the circumstances; if
  whether the contract enables the person to do so is indeterminate, or is the
  subject of an inextricable conditional, the action is IMPOSSIBLE. A person
  SHALL NOT cause a contract to violate a rule using this method.

  If a rule specifies that a contract SHALL or SHALL NOT do something, each
  party to the contract SHALL ensure that the contract respectively does
  or does not do that thing.

  The text of a contract can permit persons to act on behalf of a party or
  group of parties. To do so, it must specify:

    a. Which of its parties can be acted on behalf of;
    b. What actions can be taken;
    c. Who can take the actions; and
    d. Any conditions or limitations upon the actions. If any such
       limitations or conditions are inextricable, the actions CANNOT be used.
