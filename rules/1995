  Each Unit of Land has a Land Type switch, tracked by the
  Cartographor. Possible values are:

  1. Black
  2. White
  3. Gray
  4. Aether (the default)

  Changes to Land Type switches are secured. To "change the type"
  of, or to "transform" a Unit of Land is to flip its Type switch. A
  “Unit of X” is a Unit of Land whose Land Type switch has the value
  X.

  When existent Land has not had its Type changed as explicitly
  permitted by the Rules, or has a Type that is not currently
  defined by the Rules, it is considered to have the Land Type of
  Aether. Rules to the contrary nonwithstanding, Units of Aether
  CANNOT be transferred from Agora, or owned by any entity other
  than Agora.

  If Proprietary Land becomes Aether, the Cartographor SHALL
  transfer it to Agora in a timely fashion, destroy any facilities
  on the Land Unit, and set all other switches on the Land Unit to
  their default values.

  Alternating Land Type is a singleton switch with the values of
  Black and White, defaulting to Black. When an act specifies that
  an alternating land type is to be used, the current value of the
  Alternating Land Type switch is used, and the switch is set to the
  next value of the switch.
