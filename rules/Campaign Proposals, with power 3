- Created by Proposal 7912 "Election Campaigns" (Alexis), 15 October 2017
text: |
  During the nomination period of an election, any candidate for that election
  CAN submit a Campaign Proposal for that election, provided e does not
  currently have a pending Campaign Proposal for that election, using the normal
  mechanism for proposal submission. Campaign Proposals SHOULD relate to the
  duties of the office up for election. Commitment is an untracked Campaign
  Proposal switch with values Committed (default) and Uncommitted. The author
  of a Committed proposal may flip it to Uncommitted by announcement.

  A Campaign Proposal is an Official Proposal exempt from automatic
  distribution, and SHALL NOT be distributed as required by the rules.
  The election with which a Campaign Proposal is associated, as well as its
  Commitment, are essential parameters for an Agoran decision to adopt a
  Campaign Proposal.

  When a Campaign Proposal is adopted, it CANNOT take effect until
  the associated election ends. When the election ends, if the winner was the
  proposal's author, then any player CAN once make it take effect by
  announcement (with its power set as usual for an adopted proposal). If the
  conditions for a Campaign Proposal to take effect are met as a result of an
  action in a public message, the author of the message SHALL make it take
  effect in that message.
