  When a Rule specifies that a random choice be made, then the
  choice shall be made using whatever probability distribution among
  the possible outcomes the Rule specifies, defaulting to a uniform
  probability distribution.

  The choice CAN be made using any physical or computational process
  whose probability distribution among the possible outcomes is
  reasonably close to that required by the Rules, and for which the
  final choice is not trivially predictable by the selecting person
  in advance. The selecting person SHOULD make the selection method
  public, and SHOULD use a method for which the final probability
  distribution can be readily confirmed.
