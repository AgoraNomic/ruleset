  Any person (the initiator) can initiate a Call for Judgement (CFJ,
  syn. Judicial Case), specifying a statement to be inquired into:

  a) by announcement, if e has not previously initiated any CFJs in
     the current week, OR

  b) by announcement by spending the current CFJ cost in shinies.

  When a person initiates a Call for Judgment, e CAN optionally bar
  one person from the case by announcement.

  At any time, each CFJ is either open (default), suspended, or
  assigned exactly one judgement.

  The Arbitor is an office, responsible for the administration of
  justice in a manner that is fair for emself, if not for the rest
  of Agora.

  When a CFJ has no judge assigned, the Arbitor CAN assign any
  eligible player to be its judge by announcement, and SHALL do so
  within a week. The players eligible to be assigned as judge are
  all players except the initiator and the person barred (if any).
  The Arbitor SHALL assign judges over time such that all interested
  players have reasonably equal opportunities to judge. If a CFJ has
  no judge assigned, then any player eligible to judge that CFJ CAN
  assign it to emself Without 3 Objections.

  The Arbitor's weekly report includes a summary of recent judicial
  case activity, including open and recently-judged cases, recent
  judicial assignments, and a list of players interested in judging.

    A CFJ can be unambiguously referenced by using the
    customarily-assigned sequence numbers, even if the number was
    not assigned in the public forum, provided that those involved
    accept it as unambiguous at the time.

    Titles for CFJs are unregulated, so it is possible for a title
    to be assigned to a CFJ informally.
