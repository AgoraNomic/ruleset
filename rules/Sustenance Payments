  The Notary CAN, once a month, cause each contract that owns at least
  one shiny to transfer one shiny to Agora. E SHALL do so in the first week
  of every month. If a contract does not own at least one shiny, and is
  thus unable to make said payment, the Notary CAN and SHALL destroy
  it With Notice. If a contract becomes and remains able to pay before its
  destruction, the Notary CANNOT destroy it, and CAN and SHALL instead
  collect the shiny.

  The Notary CAN, by regulation, exempt a contract from the preceding paragraph.
  E SHALL NOT do so unless the contract seems to be in the public interest of
  Agora.
