  A player CAN expedite a proposal whose adoption index is at most
  1.5, in a message containing the character string "[Expedition]"
  in the subject line,

    (a) by specially deputising for the Promotor to distribute the
        proposal, if it has not been distributed; or
    (b) by announcement, otherwise.

  If, in an Agoran Decision to adopt a proposal, the strength of
  AGAINST is zero, and the proposal was expedited at least 7 days
  earlier, then any player CAN specially deputise for the Assessor
  to resolve the decision.
