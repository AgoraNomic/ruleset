  The Silver Quill is an annual award designed to honor the authors
  of proposals of outstanding merit and influence on the game.

  In a timely fashion after the end of each Agoran Year, the Herald
  SHALL initiate and Agoran Decision to determine which Proposal has
  most greatly influenced that (ending) year of play.

  For this decision, the valid options are all proposals adopted
  between November 1 of the year prior to the ending year, and
  October 31 of the ending year. The vote collector is the Herald,
  and the voting method is instant runoff.

  Players are ENCOURAGED to discuss which eligible proposals best
  satisfy the aforementioned criteria. Proposals submitted by new
  players SHOULD be given somewhat higher weight, but the primary
  reference should be the proposals themselves and their effect on
  the game since adoption.

  Upon the resolution of the decision, if the outcome is not FAILED
  QUORUM and there were at least three votes containing it in any
  preference slot, that proposal wins the Ceremony, and the Herald
  CAN once, by announcement, award its author the Patent Title of
  "Silver Quill YYYY, substituting the ending year; otherwise, there
  is no winner.
