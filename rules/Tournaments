     A Tournament is a sub-game of Agora specifically sanctioned to
     be initiated as a tournament by the Rules. If a winner of a
     tournament is determined within 4 weeks of its initiation, that
     person or persons win the game, otherwise the tournament
     concludes with no winner. A Tournament is governed by a special
     temporary title of the ACORN, created in accordance with its
     parent rule, which have binding control over those who freely
     agree to play the tournament and over the tournament itself.
     Once the tournament is concluded, these regulations cease to
     have any effect, and CAN be repealed by any player by
     announcement.
