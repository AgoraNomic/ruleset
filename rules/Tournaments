   A Tournament is a sub-game of Agora specifically sanctioned
   to be initiated as a tournament by the Rules.  If a winner of a
   tournament is determined within 4 weeks of its initiation, that
   person or persons win the game, otherwise the tournament
   concludes with no winner. A Tournament is governed by a special temporary
   title of the ACORN, created in accordance with its parent rule,
   which have binding control over those who freely agree to play the tournament
   and over the tournament itself. Once the tournament is concluded, these
   regulations cease to have any effect, and may be repealed by any player by
   announcement.
