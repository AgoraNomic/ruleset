  The Short Logical Ruleset (SLR) is a format of the ruleset. In
  this format, each rule is assigned to a category, and the rules
  are grouped according to their category.

  Rules are assigned to, ordered within, or moved between
  categories, and categories are added, changed, or empty categories
  removed, as the Rulekeepor sees fit.

  The listing of each rule in the SLR must include the rule's ID
  number, revision number, power, title, and text.

  The Rulekeepor is strongly DISCOURAGED from including any
  additional information in the SLR, except that which increases the
  readability of the SLR.

  The Full Logical Ruleset (FLR) is a format of the ruleset. In this
  format, rules are assigned to the same category and presented in
  the same order as in the SLR. The FLR must contain all the
  information required to be in the SLR, and any historical
  annotations which the Rulekeepor is required to record.

  The Rulekeepor SHOULD also include any other information which e
  feels may be helpful in the use of the ruleset in the FLR.

  Whenever a rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeepor SHALL record
  a historical annotation to the rule indicating:

  1. The type of change.

  2. The date on which the change took effect.

  3. The mechanism that specified the change.

  4. If the rule was changed due to a proposal, then that proposal's
     ID number, author, and co-author(s) (if any).
