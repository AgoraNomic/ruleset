  Any group of two or more consenting persons (the parties) may
  make an agreement among themselves with the intention that it be
  binding upon them and be governed by the rules. Such an agreement
  is known as a contract. A contract may be modified, including
  by changing the set of parties, by agreement between all existing
  parties. A contract may also terminate by agreement between all
  parties. A contract automatically terminates if the number of
  parties to it falls below two. It is IMPOSSIBLE for a person to
  become a party to a contract without eir agreement. For the
  purposes of this rule, agreement includes both consent and
  agreement specified by contract.

  Parties to a contract governed by the rules SHALL act in
  accordance with that contract. This obligation is not impaired
  by contradiction between the contract and any other contract, or
  between the contract and the rules.

  A party to a contract CAN perform any of the following actions
  as permitted by the contract's text:

  * Act on behalf of another party to the contract.

  * By announcement, revoke destructible assets from the contract.

  * By announcement, take liquid assets from the contract.
