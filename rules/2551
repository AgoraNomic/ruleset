  An Auction ends 7 days after its initiation, or immediately if no
  bid has been placed or withdrawn in the last 96 hours, or
  immediately if it is terminated.

  When an Auction ends, any bid placed by an entity which does not
  own enough of the Auction's currency to pay the amount specified
  in the bid is automatically withdrawn.

  Once an Auction has ended, any further attempts to bid on that
  Auction or to withdraw bids from that Auction are INEFFECTIVE.

  Once the Auction has ended, the Auction's announcer SHALL announce
  the end of the Auction in a timely fashion. In the same message, e
  SHALL include the a list of all the bids on the Auction and the
  winner(s) (if there are any) of the Auction.

  The bidders in an Auction are the players who have a non-withdrawn
  bid in that Auction. Priority is a strict total ordering over the
  bidders in an Auction. For two bidders with different bid amounts
  on their non-withdrawn bids, the bidder with the higher bid has
  higher priority than the other bidder; otherwise, the bidder whose
  non-withdrawn bid was placed earlier has higher priority than the
  other bidder.

  Upon the end of an Auction, for each lot, in the order they are to
  be awarded, the bidder with the highest priority in the Auction
  who is not yet the winner of a lot becomes the winner of the lot.
  If there are more lots than there are persons with non-withdrawn
  bids, the excess lots are not won by any person.
  
  The winner of the lot SHALL, in a timely fashion, pay a fee (the
  number of the Auction's currency equal to eir bid) to the
  Auctioneer in order to satisfy eir auction debt. When e does so,
  if the auctioneer CAN transfer the items in that lot to that
  winner, e immediately does so; otherwise, e SHALL do so in
  a timely fashion.

    An auction normally ends immediately after its initiation, since, at its
    commencement, no bid was placed or withdrawn in the previous 96 hours.
