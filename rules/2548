  Each Auction has an Announcer. Only persons can be Announcers.

  If the Auctioneer of an Auction is a player, then that player is
  the Announcer of that Auction.

  Otherwise, the rule or contract defining an Auction CAN define the
  Announcer for that Auction. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding,
  no Contract can define a person as the Announcer of an Auction
  unless that person is a party to that Contract.
