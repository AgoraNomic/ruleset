  The Notary CAN, once a month, cause each contract that owns at
  least one shiny to transfer one shiny to Agora. E SHALL do so in
  the first Eastman week of every month. If a contract does not own
  at least one shiny, and is thus unable to make said payment, the
  Notary CAN and SHALL destroy it With Notice. If a contract becomes
  and remains able to pay before its destruction, the Notary CANNOT
  destroy it, and CAN and SHALL instead collect the shiny.

  The Notary CAN, by regulation, exempt a contract from the
  preceding paragraph. E SHALL NOT do so unless the contract seems
  to be in the public interest of Agora.
