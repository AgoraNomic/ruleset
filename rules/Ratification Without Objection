  Any player CAN, without objection, ratify a public document,
  specifying its scope.

  Ratification Without Objection CANNOT cause the repeal,
  amendment, enactment, or mutation of any Rule, rules to the
  contrary notwithstanding.

  A player SHALL NOT knowingly use or announce intent to use
  Ratification Without Objection to ratify a (prior to
  ratification) document containing incorrect or Indeterminate
  information when a corrected document could be produced with
  reasonable effort, unless the general nature of the document's
  error and reason for ratifying it is clearly and plainly
  described in the announcement of intent.  Such ratification
  or announcement of intent to ratify is the Class-8 Crime of
  Endorsing Forgery.

  text: Ratification of an official document affects only those aspects of gamestate
    that are defined to be part of the official report, and not aspects that are incidentally
    reported on; in particular, ratification of an official report on certain parameters
    pertaining to each player does not ratify the list of players.
