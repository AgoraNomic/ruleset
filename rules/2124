  A Supporter of a dependent action is an eligible entity who has
  publicly posted (and not withdrawn) support (syn. "consent") for
  an announcement of intent to perform the action. An Objector to a
  dependent action is an eligible entity who has publicly posted
  (and not withdrawn) an objection to the announcement of intent to
  perform the action.

  The entities eligible to support or object to a dependent action
  are, by default, all players, subject to modification by the
  document authorizing the dependent action. However, the previous
  sentence notwithstanding, the Executor of the announcement of
  intent is not eligible to support it.

  Agora is Satisfied with an intent to perform a specific action if
  and only if:

  1. if the action is to be performed Without N Objections, then it
     has fewer than N objectors; 

  2. if the action is to be performed With N supporters, then it has
     N or more supporters; and 

  3. if the action is to be performed with N Agoran Consent, then
     the ratio of supporters to objectors is greater than N, or the
     action has at least one supporter and no objectors. 

  4. if the action is to be performed With Notice or With T Notice.

  The above notwithstanding, if the action depends on objections,
  and an objection to it has been withdrawn within the past 24
  hours, then Agora is not Satisfied with the intent.

  The above notwithstanding, Agora is not satisfied with the intent
  if the Speaker has objected to it in the last 48 hours.

  A person CANNOT support or object to an announcement of intent
  before the intent is announced, or after e has withdrawn the same
  type of response.
