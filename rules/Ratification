  A public document is part (possibly all) of a public message.

  When a public document is ratified, rules to the contrary
  notwithstanding, the gamestate is modified to what it would be if,
  at the time the ratified document was published, the gamestate had
  been minimally modified to make the ratified document as true and
  accurate as possible. Such a modification cannot add
  inconsistencies between the gamestate and the rules, and it cannot
  include rule changes unless the ratified document explicitly and
  unambiguously recites either the changes or the resulting
  properties of the rule(s). If no such modification is possible, or
  multiple substantially distinct possible modifications would be
  equally appropriate, the ratification fails.

  An internally inconsistent document generally cannot be ratified;
  however, if such a document can be divided into a summary section
  and a main section, where the only purpose of the summary section
  is to summarize information in the main section, and the main
  section is internally consistent, ratification of the document
  proceeds as if it contained only the main section.

  Text purportedly about previous instances of ratification (e.g. a
  report's date of last ratification) is excluded from ratification.
  The rules may define additional information that is considered to
  be part of the document for the purposes of ratification; such
  definitions are secured at a Power Threshold of 3.

  Ratifying a public document is secured with power threshold 3.
