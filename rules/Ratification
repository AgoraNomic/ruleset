  A public document is part (possibly all) of a public message.

  When a public document is ratified, rules to the contrary
  notwithstanding, the gamestate is modified to what it would be
  if, at the time the ratified document was published, the
  gamestate had been minimally modified to make the ratified
  document as true and accurate as possible.  Such a modification
  cannot add inconsistencies between the gamestate and the rules,
  and it cannot include rule changes unless the ratified document
  explicitly and unambiguously recites either the changes or the
  resulting properties of the rule(s).  If no such modification is
  possible, or multiple substantially distinct possible
  modifications would be equally appropriate, the ratification
  fails.

  An internally inconsistent document generally cannot be
  ratified; however, if such a document can be divided into a
  summary section and a main section, where the only purpose of
  the summary section is to summarize information in the main
  section, and the main section is internally consistent,
  ratification of the document proceeds as if it contained only
  the main section.

  Text purportedly about previous instances of ratification (e.g.
  a report's date of last ratification) is excluded from
  ratification. The rules may define additional information that
  is considered to be part of the document for the purposes of
  ratification; such definitions are secured at a Power
  Threshold of 3.

  Ratifying a public document is secured with power threshold 3.
