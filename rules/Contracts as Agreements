text: |
  The text of a contract can specify obligations upon its parties. Parties to
  a contract SHALL abide by its terms, breaching them neither negligently nor
  deliberately. The fact that the action described by the contract is in
  violation of the rules is not a defense if the violative nature is
  reasonably clear from its text. If whether an action is permitted or forbidden
  by a contract is indeterminate or subject to an inextricable conditional,
  it is presumptively permitted.

  As an exception to the provisions of the previous paragraph and the
  circumstances in which cards would ordinarily be appropriate, a person
  awarding a card under this rule MAY and CAN validly consider the equitable
  interests of justice and interests of the game, including the importance of
  the observation of contracts, as a mitigating or aggravating circumstances
  when awarding a card. Such a person MAY, CAN validly, and SHOULD also consider
  the instructions of the contract or contracts in question when issuing a card.
