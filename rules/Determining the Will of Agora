  Each Agoran decision has a voting method, which determines how
  voters may vote on it and how to calculate the outcome. The
  strength of a ballot is the voting strength of the voter who
  cast it on that Agoran decision.

  The following voting methods are defined:

  1. AI-majority: the valid votes are FOR and AGAINST. Let F be
     the total strength of all valid ballots cast FOR a decision,
     A be the same for AGAINST, and AI be the adoption index of
     the decision. The outcome is ADOPTED if F/A >= AI and F/A >
     1 (or F>0 and A=0), otherwise REJECTED.

  2. Instant runoff: the valid votes are ordered lists of
     options, and the outcome is whichever option wins according
     to the standard definition of instant runoff. For this
     purpose, a ballot of strength N is treated as if it were N
     distinct ballots expressing the same preferences. In case
     multiple valid options tie for the lowest number of votes at
     any stage, the vote collector CAN and must, in the
     announcement of the decision's resolution, select one such
     option to eliminate; if, for M > 1, all eir possible choices
     in the next M stages would result in the same set of options
     being eliminated, e need not specify the order of
     elimination.

  3. First-past-the-post (default): the valid votes are the
     options, and the outcome is whichever option received the
     highest total strength of valid ballots. In case of a tie,
     the vote collector CAN and must, in the announcement of the
     decision's resolution, select one of the leaders as the
     outcome.

  The previous notwithstanding:

  - If there is more than one option, and the number of valid
    ballots is less than the quorum of that decision, the outcome
    is instead FAILED QUORUM.
  - PRESENT is always a valid vote, with no effect on the outcome
    except counting towards quorum.
  - If there are no valid options, the outcome is null.

  The outcome of a decision is determined when it is resolved, and
  cannot change thereafter.
