  A Post is a position which can be held by at most one Politician.
  Each Politican can hold at most one Post at a time. Each Post is
  in an Echelon, which has an associated Rank. The Echelons, and
  their Posts and Ranks, are as follows:

  Chamber of Power (Rank 5):

  - Host

  Upper Echelon (Rank 3):

  - Planner

  - Enforcer

  - Organizer

  - Creep

  Row Echelon (Rank 1):

  - Schmoozer

  - Decorator

  - Loner

  - Drunk

  - Mystery

  - Wild One

  - Hat Rack

  Each Politician who holds a Post is in the Echelon of that post;
  other Politicians are in the Row-Reduced Echelon, which has Rank
  0. Likewise, the Rank of a Post or Politician is the Rank of their
  Echelon.

  If a rule provides that a Post can take an action, then the
  Advisor of the holder of that Post CAN take that action. If there
  is no such player, and the Post is required to take that action,
  then the Clork CAN do it prior to any deadline for its
  performance. After a deadline for a Post to perform an action, any
  player CAN take it.
