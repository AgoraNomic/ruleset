  The Silver Quill is an annual award designed to honor the
  authors of proposals of outstanding merit and influence on the
  game.

  In a timely fashion after the end of each Agoran Year, the
  Herald SHALL initiate and Agoran Decision to determine which
  Proposal has most greatly influenced that (ending) year of play.

  For this decision, the valid options are all proposals adopted
  between November 1 of the year prior to the ending year, and
  October 31 of the ending year.  The vote collector is the
  Herald, and the voting method is instant runoff.

  Players are ENCOURAGED to discuss which eligible proposals best
  satisfy the aforementioned criteria.  Proposals submitted by new
  players SHOULD be given somewhat higher weight, but the primary
  reference should be the proposals themselves and their effect on
  the game since adoption.

  Upon the resolution of the decision, if the outcome is not
  FAILED QUORUM and there were at least three votes containing it
  in any preference slot, that proposal wins the Ceremony, and the
  Herald is authorized to award its author the Patent Title of
  "Silver Quill YYYY, substituting the ending year; otherwise,
  there is no winner.
