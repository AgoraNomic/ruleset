  A player CAN initiate an election for a specified office:
      a) With 2 Support, if either the office is interim or the
         most recent election for that office was resolved more
         than 90 days prior, and provided that the initiator
         becomes a candidate in the same message.
      b) By announcement, if e is the ADoP and if the office is
         interim, or if e is the holder of that office.
  The above notwithstanding, an election for an office CANNOT be
  initiated if one is already in progress.

  After an election is initiated and until nominations close, any player CAN
  become a candidate by announcement. A candidate ceases to be a candidate if e
  ceases to be a player during the election. An election is contested if it has
  two or more candidates at the end of the nomination period, and uncontested
  otherwise. For a contested election, nominations close at the end of the
  poll's voting period. For an uncontested election, nominations close at the
  end of the nomination period.

  When an election is initiated, it enters the nomination period,
  which lasts for 7 days. In a timely fashion after the nomination
  period ends, the ADoP CAN and SHALL, in the same message:
      1) If the election is contested, initiate an Agoran decision
         to select the winner of the election (the poll). For this
         decision, the Vote Collector is the Assessor, the valid
         options are the candidates for that election (including
         those who become candidates after its initiation), and the
         voting method is instant runoff.
      2) Distribute all pending Campaign Proposals associated
         with the election.
      3) If POSSIBLE per the following paragraph, end the election
         immediately.

  If at any point an uncontested election has a single candidate, and that
  candidate either is not the author of a Committed Campaign Proposal for that
  election or that proposal was adopted, then any player CAN declare them the
  winner of the election by announcement. If at any point an uncontested
  election has no candidates, or a single candidate who is the author of a
  failed Committed Campaign Proposal for that election, then any player CAN
  declare the election ended with no winner by announcement. The Assessor SHALL
  do one or the other in the same message in which e resolves a decision to
  adopt a Campaign Proposal for an ongoing uncontested election.

  A poll CANNOT be resolved until the decisions to adopt all associated Campaign
  Proposals are resolved. When resolving the poll, if a given candidate authored
  one of the associated Campaign Proposals, that proposal is Committed, and it
  was not adopted, then that player is disqualified.

  When the poll is resolved, its outcome, if a player, wins the election. When
  a player wins an election, e is installed into the associated office and the
  election ends.
