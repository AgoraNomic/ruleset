  An entity submits a ballot on an Agoran decision by publishing a
  notice satisfying the following conditions:

  1. The ballot is submitted during the voting period for the
     decision.

  2. The entity casting the ballot (the voter) was, at the
     initiation of the decision, a player.

  3. The ballot clearly identifies the matter to be decided.

  4. The ballot clearly identifies a valid vote, as determined by
     the voting method.

  5. The ballot clearly sets forth the voter's intent to place
     the identified vote.

  6. The voter has no other valid ballots on the same decision.

  A valid ballot is a ballot, correctly submitted, that has not
  been withdrawn. During the voting period of an Agoran decision,
  a player CAN by announcement withdraw (syn. retract) a ballot
  that e submitted on that decision. To "change" one's vote is to
  retract eir previous ballot (if any), then submit a new one.
