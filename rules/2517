  A conditional is any textual structure that attempts to make a
  statement (the substrate) affecting any part or aspect of the
  gamestate, or the permissibility, possibility, or effect of any
  action affecting such a part or aspect, dependent on the truth
  value or other state of a textual structure (the condition). The
  condition is said to be "affixed" to the substrate (inverse "to be
  conditional upon").

  A condition is inextricable if it is unclear, ambiguous, circular,
  inconsistent, paradoxical, depends on information that is
  indeterminate, or is impossible or unreasonably difficult to
  determine, or otherwise requires an unreasonable effort to
  resolve; otherwise it is extricable. A conditional is inextricable
  if its condition is inextricable; otherwise it is extricable. A
  player SHOULD NOT use an inextricable conditional for any purpose.

  An action is said to be "subject to" a conditional if its
  possibility, permissibility, or effect (depending on context) is
  determined by the conditional. A value is said to be subject to a
  conditional of the state of the value is determined by the
  conditional.
