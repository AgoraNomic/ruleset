  Each Estate has a Farm switch, tracked by the Agronomist, with
  values "farmed" and "unfarmed", defaulting to "unfarmed". Changes
  to Farm switches are secured. An Estate whose Farm switch is
  "farmed" is a Farm, and its owner is the Farmer of that Estate.

  In the first week of an Agoran month, the owner of an unfarmed
  Estate CAN flip its Farm switch to “farmed" by paying Agora a
  number of shinies equal to the Farm Rate, by announcement.

  In the first week of an Agoran month, the owner of a Farm CAN till
  the farm by paying Agora a number of shinies equal to the Farm
  Rate, by announcement. If the Farmer of an Estate does not till it
  within the first week of an Agoran month, the Agronomist CAN flip
  its Farm switch to "unfarmed” by announcement, and SHALL do so in
  a timely fashion.

  When an Estate is transferred to Agora or to an Organization, its
  Farm switch is set to "unfarmed" immediately afterwards
