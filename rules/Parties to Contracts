name: Parties to Contracts
history:
- Created by Proposal 7924 "Contracts v8" (Aris, o, G., ais523, Gaelan, 天火狐, CuddleBeam, V.J. Rada, Trigon, Alexis, P.S.S.), 22 October 2017
text: |
  Each contract has an associated set of persons, known as the parties. The
  person who creates a contract is automatically a party. Other persons CAN
  become parties to a contract by announcement if the contract's text permits
  them to do so. Parties can leave a contract by announcement, ceasing being
  parties, if the contract's text permits them to do so. A contract CAN expel a
  party or group of parties by announcement, causing them to cease being
  parties.

  It is IMPOSSIBLE, by any means, for a person to become a party to a contract,
  for an contract to be created with a person as a party, or for an entity to
  become a contract with a person as a party, without that person's consent.
  This rule takes precedence over any rule that might make such a change
  possible.
