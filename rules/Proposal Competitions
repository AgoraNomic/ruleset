  Any player CAN, with Agoran Consent, initiate a Proposal
  Competition with a specified Objective. Only one Competition may
  be in progress at a time. The Objective should be a
  specification of effects of a proposal, and SHOULD NOT depend on
  factors that could not be determined from the text of a
  proposal.

  During the Agoran Week following the initiation of a Proposal
  Competition, any player CAN specify that a Proposal e submits is
  a Competition Proposal for that Competition.  Players are
  ENCOURAGED to describe how their Competition Proposals fulfill
  the Objective.

  The Promotor SHALL distribute all Competition Proposals for a
  given Competition in the same message. The Assessor SHALL
  resolve all the Agoran Decisions to adopt the Competition
  Proposals for a given Competition in the same message.

  Once all Agoran decisions to adopt Competition Proposals for a
  given Competition have been resolved, the Competition ends.
