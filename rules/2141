  A rule is a type of instrument with the capacity to govern the
  game generally, and is always taking effect. A rule's content
  takes the form of a text, and is unlimited in scope.

  Every rule has power between 0.1 and 4.0 inclusive. It is not
  possible for a rule to have a power outside this range.

  Rules have ID numbers, to be assigned by the Rulekeepor.

  Every rule shall have a title to aid in identification. If a rule
  ever does not have a title, the Rulekeepor SHALL assign a title to
  it by announcement in a timely fashion.

  For the purposes of rules governing modification of instruments,
  the text, power, ID number, and title of a rule are all
  substantive aspects of the rule. However, rules to the contrary
  notwithstanding, the Rulekeepor CAN set rule aspects as described
  elsewhere in this rule.
id: 2141
rev: 9
power: 3
annotations:
- cfjs:
  - id: '1498'
    called: 2004-04-12
  text: A rule's title is not strictly a name for the rule, and so rule titles are
    not subject to the uniqueness requirement on names of rule-defined entities.
- cfjs:
  - id: '2013'
    called: 2009-06-17
  text: 'Rule 2141 does not imply that the power of rules is physically unlimited:
    they can only affect the world outside the game by prescribing or proscribing
    player behavior.'
- cfjs:
  - id: '2213'
    called: 2008-10-07
  text: The powers granted to rules by the first paragraph of Rule 2141 are general,
    and only apply as otherwise stated by the Rules.
