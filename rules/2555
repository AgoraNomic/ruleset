  Blots are an indestructible fixed currency with ownership
  restricted to persons. A person with 1 or more blots is Impure, a
  person with 0 blots is Pure. An impure unregistered person is a
  Fugitive.

  To Levy a Fine of N on a person, where N is a positive integer, is
  to create N blots in eir possession by announcement. To Expunge a
  blot is to destroy it by announcement. If expunging blots would
  reduce a person's blots to less than 0, their blots are instead
  reduced to 0 but the cost of expunging, if any, is not reduced.

  Levying fines and destroying blots are each secured with a power
  threshold of 1.7.

  The Referee is an office, and the recordkeepor for blots.

  If a player has neither gained blots nor expunged any blots from
  emself in the current Agoran week, e CAN expunge 1 blot from
  emself by announcement.

  At the beginning of each quarter, half (rounded down) of each
  fugitive's blots are destroyed.
