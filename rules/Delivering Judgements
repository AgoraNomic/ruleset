  When a CFJ is open and assigned to a judge, that judge CAN
  assign a valid judgement to it by announcement, and SHALL do so
  in a timely fashion after this becomes possible.  If e does not,
  the Arbitor CAN remove em from being the judge of that case by
  announcement.

  The valid judgements, based on the facts of the case at the time
  the CFJ was initiated, are TRUE, FALSE, and DISMISS.  DISMISS is
  appropriate if the statement is malformed, undecidable,
  irrelevant to the game, if insufficient information exists to
  make a judgement with reasonable effort, or the statement is
  otherwise not able to be answered TRUE or FALSE.

  text: A question cannot generally take the place of a statement in initiating an
    inquiry case.
- cfjs:
  - id: '1903'
    called: 6 February 2008
  text: The question-statement equivalence established by this rule applies only for
    the purposes of the subject of an inquiry case, not for acting by announcement.

  - id: '1671'
    called: 17 May 2007
  text: The truth or falsity of a statement can be determined as of the initiation
    of a CFJ even if public knowledge at the time of initiation was not sufficient
    to determine it.
- cfjs:
  - id: '1482'
    called: 10 February 2004
  text: If the truth of a CFJ statement logically depends on the truth of statements
    of a previously-called CFJ which has not yet been judged, the judge is entitled
    to treat this as a situation of insufficient information being available.
- cfjs:
  - id: '1744'
    called: 18 September 2007
  text: It is not the job of the judge to hunt down or request the information that
    would be required to render a substantive judgement.
- cfjs:
  - id: '1771'
    called: 28 October 2007
  text: If an inquiry case revolves around the interpretation of a specific message,
    and the initiator does not provide a reasonable reference to that message , the
    judge is entitled to treat this as a situation of insufficient information being
    available.

  - id: '1732'
    called: 23 August 2007
  text: If a particular player holds a particular office, and an inquiry case on a
    statement that that player holds that office is judged FALSE, that player still
    holds that office.
- cfjs:
  - id: '2281'
    called: 19 November 2008
  text: For the purposes of determining the validity of an inquiry case, the term
    "statement" should be interpreted loosely.
