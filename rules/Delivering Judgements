  When a CFJ is open and assigned to a judge, that judge CAN
  assign a valid judgement to it by announcement, and SHALL do so
  in a timely fashion after this becomes possible.  If e does not,
  the Arbitor CAN remove em from being the judge of that case by
  announcement.

  The valid judgements for an inquiry case are as follows, based
      on the truth or falsity of the statement at the time the inquiry
      case was initiated (if its truth value changed at that time,
      then its initial truth value is used):

      * FALSE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
        logically false

      * TRUE, appropriate if the statement was factually and logically
        true

      * IRRELEVANT, appropriate if the veracity of the statement is
        not relevant to the game or is an overly hypothetical
        extrapolation of the game or its rules to conditions that
        don't actually exist, or if it can be trivially determined
        from the outcome of another (possibly still undecided)
        judicial case that was not itself judged IRRELEVANT

      * INSUFFICIENT, appropriate if the statement does not come with
        supporting arguments or evidence, and the judge feels as if an
        undue burden is being placed on em by the lack of arguments and
        evidence.  A CFJ judged as INSUFFICIENT CAN and SHOULD be
        submitted again with sufficient arguments/evidence.

      * DISMISS, appropriate if the statement is malformed, undecidable,
        if insufficient information exists to make a judgement with
        reasonable effort, or the statement is otherwise not able to be
        answered with another valid judgement.

  text: The question-statement equivalence established by this rule applies only for
    the purposes of the subject of an inquiry case, not for acting by announcement.

    called: 17 May 2007
  text: The truth or falsity of a statement can be determined as of the initiation
    of a CFJ even if public knowledge at the time of initiation was not sufficient
    to determine it.
- cfjs:
  - id: '1482'
    called: 10 February 2004
  text: If the truth of a CFJ statement logically depends on the truth of statements
    of a previously-called CFJ which has not yet been judged, the judge is entitled
    to treat this as a situation of insufficient information being available.

  - id: '1744'
    called: 18 September 2007
  text: It is not the job of the judge to hunt down or request the information that
    would be required to render a substantive judgement.
- cfjs:
  - id: '1771'
    called: 28 October 2007
  text: If an inquiry case revolves around the interpretation of a specific message,
    and the initiator does not provide a reasonable reference to that message , the
    judge is entitled to treat this as a situation of insufficient information being
    available.

  text: If a particular player holds a particular office, and an inquiry case on a
    statement that that player holds that office is judged FALSE, that player still
    holds that office.

  text: For the purposes of determining the validity of an inquiry case, the term
    "statement" should be interpreted loosely.
