  Each asset has exactly one owner. If an asset's backing document
  restricts its ownership to a class of entities, then that asset
  CANNOT be gained by or transferred to an entity outside that
  class, and is destroyed if it is owned by an entity outside that
  class. The restrictions in the previous sentence are subject to
  modification by its backing document. By default, ownership of an
  asset is restricted to Agora, players, and contracts.

  If an asset would otherwise lack an owner, it is owned by the Lost
  and Found Department. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the
  Lost and Found Department can own assets of every type. Assets
  owned by the Lost and Found Department can be transferred or
  destroyed by any player without objection.
