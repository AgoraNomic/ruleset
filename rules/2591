  Spaceships are a class of fixed asset, tracked by the Astronomor,
  with ownership restricted to players. The following are Spaceship
  switches, tracked by the Astronomor:

  * Location (possible values any Sector, defaulting to the Sector
    with the lowest ID number);

  * Armour (an integer switch limited to values less than or equal
    to 10, defaulting to 10).

  A Spaceship is "in" its Location. For a Spaceship to "move" to a
  Sector is for its Location to be flipped to that Sector. When a
  player registers, a Spaceship is created in eir possession. When a
  Spaceship is created, it immediately moves to the lowest-numbered
  empty Sector, if any.

  A Spaceship with an Armour of 0 or less is "Defeated". A
  Spaceship is "Pilotable" if it is neither Defeated nor engaging
  in a Space Battle.

  Any player CAN, by announcement, spend a coin to increase the
  Armour of a Pilotable Spaceship e owns by 1. This is called
  "Repairing" the Spaceship.

  If a player does not have a spaceship in eir possession e CAN, by
  announcement, create a spaceship in eir posession.
