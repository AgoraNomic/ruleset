  Freedom of speech being essential for the healthy functioning of
  any non-Imperial nomic, it is hereby resolved that no Player
  shall be prohibited from participating in the Fora, nor shall
  any person create physical or technological obstacles that
  unduly favor some players' fora access over others.

  Publicity is a forum switch with values Public, Discussion, and
  Foreign (default), tracked by the Registrar.  Changes to
  publicity are secured.

  The Registrar may change the publicity of a forum without
  objection as long as:

  1. e sends eir announcement of intent to that forum; and

  2. if the forum is to be made public, the announcement by which
     the Registrar makes that forum public is sent to all
     existing public fora.

  Each player should ensure e can receive messages via each public
  forum.

  A public message is a message sent via a public forum, or sent
  to all players and containing a clear designation of intent to
  be public.  A rule can also designate that a part of one public
  message is considered a public message in its own right. A
  person "publishes" or "announces" something by sending a public
  message.

  Where the rules define an action that CAN be performed "by
  announcement", a person performs that action by unambiguously
  and clearly specifying the action and announcing that e performs
  it.  Any action performed by sending a message is performed at
  the time date-stamped on that message. Actions in messages
  (including sub-messages) are performed in the order they appear
  in the message, unless otherwise specified.

  text: A message is "received" when the message enters the recipient's normal technical
    domain of control, whether this be eir private machine or eir private account
    on a shared machine (but not the shared machine itself, if the recipient does
    not control it).

    called: 
  text: In order to submit a Proposal, in the sense of R1865 and elsewhere, it is
    not sufficient that a collection of text 'with the clear indication that that
    text is intended to become a Proposal' (R1483) merely be sent to the Public Forum
    by a Proposing Entity; the collection of text must also be received in the Public
    Forum.

  - id: '1314'
    called: 15 August 2001
  text: If a message sent to a public forum is rejected by the list moderator, it
    still qualifies as having been sent via a public forum.
- cfjs:
  - id: '1905'

  text: Regardless of CFJ 1314, a message has not been sent via a forum until most
    persons who have arranged to receive messages via the forum receive it.
- cfjs:
  - id: '1888'
    called: 31 January 2008
  text: Sending a message to a Discussion Forum, or other mailing list except for

  text: Public announcements must be made in the message body; the subject line is
    insignificant.
- cfjs:

    called: 5 November 2007
  text: An undescriptive or misleading subject line does not deprive the message body
    of effect.

  - id: '1880'
    called: 22 January 2008
  text: A phrase that would, in the message body, cancel the effect of the rest of
    the message, does not have such an effect if it appears in the subject line.
- cfjs:
  - id: '1761'
    called: 30 September 2007
  text: Publishing part of a message is a different action from publishing the whole
    message.
- cfjs:
  - id: '1646'
    called: 30 April 2007
  text: The act of "publishing" or "announcing" is accomplished when the message has
    left the sender's technical domain of control, indicated by one of the "Received:"
    headers.

  - id: '1695'
    called: 23 June 2007

    agreement says so.
- cfjs:
  - id: '1768'
    called: 22 October 2007
  text: The right of participation in the fora is the right to participate in them
    for their intended purposes, and is not necessarily infringed by regulations regarding
    the manner and type of participation.
- cfjs:
  - id: '1738'
    called: 29 August 2007
  text: An obligation on a player to not publish statements that e believes are true
    would conflict with the right of participation in the fora.
- cfjs:
  - id: '1719'
    called: 12 August 2007

    approval.

  - id: '1621'
    called: 8 February 2007
  text: Where an action can be performed by announcement, announcing that one deems
    something to be the case that would result from that action does not constitute
    performing the action.

  text: ' Saying "I do X 1000 times", where X is something that can be done by announcement,
    is an acceptable shorthand for 1000 instances of "I do X", but this shorthand
    cannot be used with an infinite repeat count, because it is impossible to write
    out an infinite number of instances of "I do X".'

  text: Saying "I do X 10000 times", where X is something that can be done by announcement,
    does not necessarily achieve 10000 instances of X, if writing out 10000 instances
    of "I do X" would be a substantial effort such that using the shorthand is abusive.  The
    presumption is in favour of the shorthand being successful.
- cfjs:
  - id: '1775'
    called: 1 November 2007
  text: If an announcement of the form "I do X N times" is not be acceptable shorthand
    for N instances of "I do X", then the announcement is completely nullified, and
    does not have the effect of M instances of "I do X" for any non-zero repeat count
    M.

- cfjs:
  - id: '1971'
    called: 22 May 2008
  text: An announcement with a general disclaimer as to its contents cannot fulfill
    a requirement to report information, but it may successfully cause game actions
    to be taken if the actions do not depend on the truth value of the disclaimed
    contents.
- cfjs:

- cfjs:
  - id: '2112'

  text: An action is only taken by announcement if the Rules define it as such; e.g.,
    posting an objection to a dependent action is not an action taken by announcement.

    taken by announcement.
