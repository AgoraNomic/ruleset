  For a player to 'earn' a coin is for it to be created in eir
  possession.  For a player to 'lose' a coin is for it to be
  destroyed (if e has any).

    - If the outcome was ADOPTED, its author earns a number of coins
      equal to (the total strength of all valid ballots cast FOR the
      decision - the total strength of all valid ballots cast AGAINST)
      times the adoption index of the decision (final result rounded
      up).

    - If the outcome was REJECTED, its author loses a number of coins
      equal to (the minimum of (the total strength of all valid ballots
      cast AGAINST the decision - the total strength of all valid
      ballots cast FOR) and 0).

    - If the outcome was FAILED QUORUM, every active player who didn't
      cast a ballot loses 1 coin.
