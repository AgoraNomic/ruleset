  The Registrar is an office; its holder is responsible for
  keeping track of players.

  The Registrar's weekly report includes:

  1. A list of all players, including information sufficient to
     identify and contact each player.

  2. The date on which each player most recently became a player.

  3. For each forum with non-Foreign publicity, sufficient
     instructions for players to receive messages there.

  The Registrar's monthly report includes:

  1. For each former player for which the information is
     reasonably available, the dates on which e registered and
     deregistered.

  In the first week of every month the Registrar SHALL attempt to
  deregister every player that has not sent a message to a public
  forum in the preceding month.

  The Registrar's duties and abilities also include:

  * Changing the publicity of a forum, as described in Rule 478.

  * Publishing Cantus Cygnei and Writs of FAGE as described in
    Rule 1789.

  The Registrar is also responsible for tracking any switches, defined in a rule,
  that would otherwise lack an officer to track them, unless the switch is
  defined as untracked.
