  The Registrar is an office; its holder is responsible for
  keeping track of players.

  The Registrar's weekly report includes:

  1. A list of all players, including information sufficient to
     identify and contact each player.

  2. The date on which each player most recently became a player.

  3. For each forum with non-Foreign publicity, sufficient
     instructions for players to receive messages there.

  The Registrar's monthly report includes:

  1. For each former player for which the information is
     reasonably available, the dates on which e registered and
     deregistered.

  In the first week of every month the Registrar SHALL attempt to
  deregister every player that has not sent a message to a public
  forum in the preceding month.

  The Registrar's duties and abilities also include:

  * Changing the publicity of a forum, as described in Rule 478.

  * Publishing Cantus Cygnei and Writs of FAGE as described in
    Rule 1789.

  The Registrar is also responsible for tracking any switches that
  would otherwise lack an officer to track them, unless the switch
  is defined as untracked.
