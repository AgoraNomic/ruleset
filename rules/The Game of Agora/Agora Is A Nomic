  Agora is ossified if it is IMPOSSIBLE for any reasonable
  combination of actions by players to cause arbitrary rule
  changes to be made and/or arbitrary proposals to be adopted
  within a four-week period.

  If, but for this rule, the net effect of a proposal would cause
  Agora to become ossified, or would cause Agora to cease to
  exist, it cannot take effect, rules to the contrary
  notwithstanding.  If any other single change to the gamestate
  would cause Agora to become ossified, or would cause Agora to
  cease to exist, it is cancelled and does not occur, rules to the
  contrary notwithstanding.
