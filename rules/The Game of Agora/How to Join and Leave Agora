  Any organism that is generally capable of freely originating and
  communicating independent thoughts and ideas is a person.  Rules
  to the contrary notwithstanding, no other entities are persons.

  Citizenship is a person switch with values Unregistered
  (default) and Registered, tracked by the Registrar.  Changes to
  citizenship are secured.  A registered person is a Player.

  A person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or prevented by the
  rules) register by publishing a message that indicates
  reasonably clearly and reasonably unambiguously that e intends
  to become a player at that time.  A person, by registering,
  agrees to abide by the Rules.  The Rules CANNOT otherwise bind a
  person to abide by any agreement without that person's willful
  consent.

  A player CAN deregister (cease being a player) by announcement.
  If e does so, e CANNOT register by announcement for 30 days.

  If a player has not sent a message to a public forum in the last
  month, then any player CAN deregister em without objection.

  The Rules CANNOT compel non-players to act, nor compel players
  to unduly harass non-players.  A non-person CANNOT be a player,
  rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

    as a request for registration, whether or not it is explicitly phrased in the
    manner stipulated by the rules.
