  If multiple rules attempt to define an entity with the same name,
  then they refer to the same entity. A rule-defined entity's name
  CANNOT be changed to be the same as another rule-defined entity's
  name.

  A rule, contract, or regulation that refers to an entity by name
  refers to the entity that had that name when the rule first came
  to include that reference, even if the entity's name has since
  changed.

  If the entity that defines another entity is amended such that it
  no longer defines the second entity, then the second entity and
  its attributes cease to exist.

  If the entity that defines another entity is amended such that it
  defines the second entity both before and after the amendment, but
  with different attributes, then the second entity and its
  attributes continue to exist to whatever extent is possible under
  the new definitions.
