  A new case is a judicial case that has not had any judge
  assigned to it.  The initiator of a new case CAN retract it by
  announcement, thus causing it to cease to be a judicial case.

  An excess case is a new case whose initiator previously
  initiated five or more cases during the same week as that case.
  A person SHALL NOT initiate an excess case.  The Arbitor CAN
  refuse an excess case by announcement, thus causing it to cease
  to be a judicial case.  When e does so, e fulfills any
  obligations with regards to that case.
