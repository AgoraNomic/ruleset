power: 2.5
text: |
  A contract is a ruleset-defined entity embodied in text. An entity
  can only become a contract through the appropriate ruleset defined
  procedures. Changes to the contract's text by rule defined
  mechanisms (including those delegated to the contract itself) do
  not change the identity of the contract.

  If any change to a contract's text, internal state, or other
  properties would cause them to become indeterminate and remain so
  for any non-infinitesimal amount of time, the change is canceled
  and does not occur.

  The following changes are secured at power 2.1: creating or
  modifying a contract or causing an entity to become a contract. 

  The properties of contracts, as defined by other rules, include
  the following:

  - Parties, persons who agree to be bound by and assume powers
    under the contract.

  - The ability to be amended or destroyed.

  - The ability to compel actions by their parties.

  - The ability to allow persons to take actions on the part of
    their parties.

  - The ability to define arbitrary classes of asset.

  - The ability to possess and control assets.
