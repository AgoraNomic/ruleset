  An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
  initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
  to initiate the decision. This notice is invalid if it lacks any
  of the following information, and the lack is correctly identified
  within one week after the notice is published:

  1. The matter to be decided (for example, "the adoption of
     proposal 4781");

  2. The voting method;

  3. A clear description of the valid options;

  4. The identity of the vote collector; and

  5. Any additional information defined by the rules as essential
     parameters.

  The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting period
  for the decision. The voting period lasts for 7 days. The minimum
  voting period for a decision with at least two options is five
  days. The vote collector for a decision with less than two options
  CAN and SHALL end the voting period by announcement, if it has not
  ended already, and provided that e resolves the decision in the
  same message.

  The voting period for a decision cannot be set or changed to a
  duration longer than fourteen days.

    The intent to initiate the decision and the information required
    in the notice need not be explicit.

    If the notice does not mention voter eligibility but the type of
    Agoran decision is clear and the rule defining the relevant type
    of Agoran decision fully determines the class of eligible
    voters, then the notice thereby implicitly describes the class
    of eligible voters.

    Information that is explicitly presented in the notice takes
    precedence over any information that would be implicit, even
    where the explicit information is inaccurate and the implicit
    information would have been accurate.

    If a R107 notice initiating an Agoran decision does not contain
    an explicit list of the eligible voters, and there is later a
    dispute (evidenced by submission of a CFJ) over which voters
    were eligible at that time, then the notice's description of the
    class of eligible voters was necessarily insufficient to enable
    public agreement on which persons are eligible.

    The set of eligible voters on an Agoran decision can change
    during its voting period.
