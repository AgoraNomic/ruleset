  A player CAN issue the title's writ
  once a month to another, who
  this month a different writ they yet remit,
  by having the first player pays its due
  of ten shinies and announces intent.
  If a party remits, they are disgraced;
  else the pair must to the public present
  a poem each which then Agorans be faced
  with a Decision of which one is better.
  Each task a timely manner it be done,
  The winner gains the loser as debtor,
  of whose function this rule shall provide none.
