  For an Agoran decision on whether to adopt a proposal, let F be
  the total number of valid ballots resolving to FOR, A be the same
  for AGAINST, and T be the total number of valid ballots. The
  decision's popularity is equal to (F - A)/T. The Assessor SHOULD
  publish the popularity of each decision when resolving it.

  The player who proposed the adopted proposal such that the
  decision on whether to adopt it had the greatest popularity, among
  all such decisions assessed in the last 7 days CAN once earn one
  Legislative Card by announcement, provided that no decision on
  whether to adopt any proposal distributed in the same message
  remains unresolved. If there is a tie, all authors of the tied
  proposals can do so once each.
