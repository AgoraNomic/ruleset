  Facilities are liquid assets tracked by the Cartographor. In order
  for a facility to exist, it must be built on a Land Unit. Only one
  facility is allowed per Land Unit. The Land Unit on which a
  Facility is built is considered its Parent Land Unit.

  A player CAN create a facility by announcement on the land unit e
  is on by specifying which type of facility e intends to build and
  destroying the build cost. Facilities on proprietary land can be
  destroyed by the owner by announcement. Facilities on public land
  can be destroyed Without Objection.

  If an entity other than Agora owns any facilities with upkeep
  costs, e must pay them before the first day of the next Agoran
  month. Failing to do this destroys the facility. In the second to
  last Eastman week of the Agoran Month, the Cartographor SHOULD
  issue a humiliating public reminder to all those who have not paid
  upkeep fees on any of eir facilities.

  Facilities always have the same owner as their parent land unit.
  If the owner of a facility is ever not the same as that of its
  parent land unit, it is transferred to the owner of its parent
  land unit.
