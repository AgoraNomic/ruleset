  Facilities are liquid assets tracked by the Cartographor. In order
  for a facility to exist, it MUST be built on a Land Unit. Only one
  facility is allowed per Land Unit. The Land Unit on which a
  Facility is built is considered its Parent Land Unit.

  A player CAN create a facility by announcement on the land unit e
  is on by specifying which type of facility e intends to build and
  destroying the build cost.

  If a player owns any facilities with upkeep costs, e must pay them
  before the first day of the next Agoran month. Failing to do this
  destroys the facility. In the second to last Eastman week of the
  Agoran Month, the Cartographor SHOULD issue a humiliating public
  reminder to all those who have not paid upkeep fees on any of eir
  facilities.

  If the ownership of the Parent Land Unit of a Facilty is changed,
  that facility is transferred along with it.
