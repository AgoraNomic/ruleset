  A Comestible is a type of liquid asset, which can be owned by players.
  Creating Comestibles is secured. The recordkeepor of Comestibles is the
  Agronomist.

  The Farmer of an Estate may offer Comestibles by announcement, naming a
  number of Comestibles offered and a price per Comestible in Shinies. A
  player CANNOT offer more Comestibles in a month than 10 times the number
  of Farms e owns. The Farmer is ENCOURAGED to name the kind of Comestibles
  on offer after a plant, vegetable, grain, livestock, or other farm good.

  A player other than the offering Farmer may accept a Comestibles offer by
  announcement to create that number of Comestibles in eir possession, if e
  pays the offering Farmer the price per Comestible named in the offer times
  the number of Comestbiles offered. The Value of a Comestible created this
  way is equal to the price per Comestible offered by the Farmer.

  An offer expires at the end of the Agoran month in which it is made. Rules
  to the contrary notwithstanding, an offer CANNOT be accepted if it has
  expired.

  During an Agoran Decision, a player can increase their voting strength on
  that decision by destroying (syn. "eating", "consuming") Comestibles. Eir
  voting strength is increased by one-tenth the total Value of the
  Comestibles destroyed this way, rounded down, to a maximum of 5.

  A Comestible is an Expired Comestible if it was created by accepting an
  offer announced more than three Agoran months ago. An Expired Comestible
  CANNOT be consumed to increase voting strength, and MAY be destroyed by
  any player, by announcement. The Agronomist SHALL destroy all Expired
  Comestibles at the start of each Agoran month.
