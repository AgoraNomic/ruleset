name: Regulated Actions
power: 3
text: |
  An action is regulated if: (1) the Rules limit, allow, enable, or
  permit its performance; (2) describe the circumstances under which
  the action would succeed or fail; or (3) the action would, as part
  of its effect, modify information for which some player is
  required to be a recordkeepor.

  A Regulated Action CAN only be performed as described by the
  Rules, and only using the methods explicitly specified in the
  Rules for performing the given action. The Rules SHALL NOT be
  interpreted so as to proscribe unregulated actions.

    Rule 2125 is an interpretive principle applied to the rules
    as a whole and not to any individual rule. For a method to
    be explicitly specified, it must actually specify a way
    that the action can be realized; it is not enough that a
    rule claims there is a method. Circular reasoning cannot be
    used to permit an action or to provide a method.
