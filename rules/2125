  An action is restricted if: (1) the Rules limit, allow, enable, or
  permit its performance; (2) describe the circumstances under which
  the action would succeed or fail; or (3) the action would, as part
  of its effect, modify information for which some player is
  required to be a recordkeepor.

  A Restricted Action CAN only be performed as described by the
  Rules, and only using the methods explicitly specified in the
  Rules for performing the given action. The Rules SHALL NOT be
  interpreted so as to proscribe unrestricted actions.
