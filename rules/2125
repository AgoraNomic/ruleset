name: Regulated Actions
power: 3
text: |
  An action is regulated by a body of law if (1) its performance is
  limited, allowed, enabled, or permitted by that body of law; (2)
  that body of law describes the circumstances under which it would
  succeed or fail; or (3) it would, as part of its effect, modify
  information for which some person bound by that body of law is
  required, by that body of law, to be a recordkeepor.

  If a body of law regulates an action, then to the extent that
  doing so is within its scope, that body of law prevents the action
  from being performed except as described within it, including by
  limiting the methods to perform that action to those specified
  within it. A body of law does not proscribed any action which it
  does not regulate.

    Rule 2125 is an interpretive principle applied to the rules
    as a whole and not to any individual rule. For a method to
    be explicitly specified, it must actually specify a way
    that the action can be realized; it is not enough that a
    rule claims there is a method. Circular reasoning cannot be
    used to permit an action or to provide a method.
