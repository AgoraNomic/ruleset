  When a rule allows one person (the agent) to act on behalf of
  another (the principal) to perform an action, that agent CAN
  perform the action if it is POSSIBLE for the principal to do so,
  taking into account any prerequisites for the action. If the
  enabling rule does not specify the mechanism by which the agent
  may do so, then the agent CAN perform the action in the same
  manner in which the principal CAN do so, with the additional
  requirement that the agent must, in the message in which the
  action is performed, uniquely identify the principal and that the
  action is being taken on behalf of that person.

  A person SHALL NOT act on behalf of another person if doing so
  causes the second person to violate the rules. A person CANNOT act
  on behalf of another person to do anything except perform a game
  action; in particular, a person CANNOT act on behalf of another
  person to send a message, only to perform specific actions that
  might be taken within a message.

  When an action is performed on behalf of a principal, then the
  action is considered for all game purposes to have been performed
  by the principal, unless a rule specifically states that it is
  treated differently for some purpose, in which case it is treated
  as described by that rule.

  Allowing a person to act on behalf of another person is secured at
  power 2.0. This rule takes precedence over any rule that would
  prohibit a person from taking an action, except that it defers to
  any rule that imposes limitations specifically on actions taken on
  behalf of another person.
