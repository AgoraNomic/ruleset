  A rule which purports to allow a person (the performer) to
  perform an action by a set of one or more of the following
  methods (N is 1 unless otherwise specified):

   1. Without N Objections, where N is a positive integer no
      greater than 8.  ("Without Objection" is shorthand for this
      method with N = 1.)
   2. With N Supporters, where N is a positive integer.  ("With
      Support" is shorthand for this method with N = 1.)
   3. With N Agoran Consent, where N is an integer multiple of 0.1
      with a minimum of 1.
   4. With Notice.
   5. With T Notice, where T is a time period.

  thereby allows em to perform the action by announcement if all
  of the following are true:

   1. A person (the initiator) announced intent to perform the action,
      unambiguously and clearly specifying the action and method(s) (including
      the value of N and/or T for each method), at most fourteen days earlier.

   2. If the action is to be performed Without N Objections, With N Agoran
      Consent, or With Notice, if the intent was announced at least 4 days
      earlier

   3. If the action is to be performed With T Notice, if the intent was
      announced at least T earlier.

   4. At least one of the following is true:

        1. The performer is the initiator.

        2. The initiator was authorized to perform the action due to holding
           a rule-defined position now held by the    performer.

        3. The initiator is authorized to perform the action, the action
           depends on support, the performer has supported the intent, and the
           rule authorizing the performance does not explicitly prohibit
           supporters from performing it.

   5. Agora is Satisfied with the announced intent, as defined by other rules.

   6. If a set of conditions for the performance of the action was given in the
      announcement of intent to perform the action, all those conditions are
      met.

  The actor SHOULD publish a list of supporters if the action
  depends on support, and a list of objectors if it depends on
  objections.
