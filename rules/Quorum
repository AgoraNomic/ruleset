  Each Agoran Decision has a quorum. This is a number set when the
  decision is created, and thereafter cannot be changed. When a
  person initiates an Agoran Decision, that person SHALL state the
  quorum of that decision. However, incorrectly stating the quorum
  of a decision does not invalidate the initiation, nor does it
  actually change the quorum of the decision.

  The quorum that an Agoran Decision gains as it is created can be
  defined by other rules of power 2 or greater. If no other rule
  defines the quorum of an Agoran Decision, the quorum for that
  decision is equal to the number of players who voted on the
  Agoran Decision to adopt a proposal that had been most recently
  resolved at the time of that decision's initiation, minus 2.

  As an exception to the previous paragraph, the quorum of an
  Agoran Decision can never be less than 2. If the rules would
  attempt to set the quorum of an Agoran Decision to less than 2,
  it is set to 2 instead.
