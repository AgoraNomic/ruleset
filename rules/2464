  A Tournament is a sub-game of Agora specifically sanctioned to be
  initiated as a tournament by the Rules. If a winner of a
  tournament is determined within 4 weeks of its initiation, that
  person or persons win the game, otherwise the tournament concludes
  with no winner. A Tournament is governed by a special temporary
  title of the ACORN, created in accordance with its parent rule,
  which have binding control over those who freely agree to play the
  tournament and over the tournament itself. Once the tournament is
  concluded, these regulations cease to have any effect, and CAN be
  repealed by any player by announcement.
