  An instrument is a type of document, either ephemeral or enduring,
  that is defined as such by a body of law. An instrument's text,
  where otherwise permitted, can be amended from time to time.

  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, an instrument other than a
  statute CANNOT become binding on a person without eir willful
  consent, however, consent can be given by implication. In
  particular, consenting to be bound to an instrument can imply
  consent to be bound by amendments to it and consent to be bound by
  other instruments.
