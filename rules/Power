  The Power of an entity is a non-negative rational number.  An
  Instrument is an entity with positive Power.

  The Power of an entity cannot be set or modified except as
  stipulated by the Rules.  All entities have Power zero except
  where specifically allowed by the rules.

  Power less than one is called Ephemeral power, and an instrument
  with a power less than one is an Ephemeral instrument.

  A Rule that makes a change, action, or value secured (hereafter
  the securing Rule) thereby makes it IMPOSSIBLE to perform that
  change or action, or to set or modify that value, except as
  allowed by an Instrument with Power greater than or equal to the
  change's Power Threshold.  This Threshold defaults to the securing
  Rule's Power, but CAN be lowered as allowed by that Rule
  (including by the Rule itself).
