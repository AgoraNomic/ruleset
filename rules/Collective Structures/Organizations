  An Organization is a type of entity. The following changes are
  secured: creating, modifying, or destroying an Organization; and
  causing an entity to become an Organization or cease to be an
  Organization.

  The Income Cap is 100.

  Budget is a switch belonging to (Organization, player) pairs
  (i.e. there is one instance of the switch for each combination
  of an Organization and a player), tracked by the Secretary,
  whose legal values are integers from 0 to the Income Cap
  inclusive, defaulting to 0. An Organization's Income is the
  total value of all Budget switches for pairs that include that
  Organization. A player's Expenditure is the total value of all
  Budget switches for pairs that include that player. Changes to
  Budget are secured.

  A "member" of an Organization is a player for which the pair
  consisting of that Organization and that player has a nonzero
  Budget.

  It is IMPOSSIBLE, by any means, for a player to become a member
  of an Organization, or for an organization to be created with a
  player as a member, without that player's explicit, willful
  consent. This rule takes precedence over any rule that might
  make such a change possible.
