  The Income Floor is 50.

  If an Organization's Income is ever lower than the Income Floor,
  then any player CAN destroy it by announcement, and the Secretary
  SHALL do so in a timely fashion if the situation persists.

  If a player's Expenditure is at most the Income Cap minus the
  Income Floor, and e is not on Lockout, then e CAN create an
  Organization by announcement, specifying a name for that
  Organization that is unique among Organizations, and a Charter.
  When an organization is created this way, its Charter is set to
  the value that e specified, and the Budget switch for that
  player and Organization is set to the Income Floor.

  Notwithstanding the above, a player CANNOT create more than one
  Organization in a day, and CANNOT create Organizations while e
  is a member of an Organization with an Income lower than the
  Income Floor.
