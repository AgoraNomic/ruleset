  There is such a thing as a Lockout Event, which can happen
  either to a person or to Agora as a whole. Lockout Events only
  happen when a Rule with power 1 or greater explicitly states
  that they happen.

  A person is on Personal Lockout if a Lockout Event happened to
  that person within the past 90 days.

  Agora is on Global Lockout if a Lockout Event happened to Agora
  as a whole within the past 7 days.

  A person is on Lockout if that person is on Personal Lockout,
  Agora is on Global Lockout, or both. A person is "off Lockout"
  if that person is not on Lockout.
