  Each Nomic Week a Player is designated the Silly Person.  The Silly Person
  SHALL in that week, by announcement (1) designate another player, who has not
  been the Silly Person in the past two weeks, to be the next week's Silly
  Person; (2) submit a Silly Proposal.  If there is ever no Silly Person or the
  Silly Person is not a player, then the next week's Silly Person is the first
  player that any player publicly designates to be the next week's Silly Person.

  A Silly Proposal is a Proposal whose sole contents are one of
  the following:
    i) A limerick.
   ii) A rhymed poem no longer than fourteen lines. (No free
       verse!)
  iii) A joke of no more than a hundred words.
   iv) A truly hideous pun.

  The first Silly Proposal submitted by the week's Silly Person is an Official
  Proposal.
