  A player (the deputy) CAN perform an action ordinarily reserved
  for an office-holder as if e held the office if

  1. the rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of
  holding that office, to perform the action (this requirement is
  fulfilled by the deputy performing the action);

  2. it would be POSSIBLE for the deputy to perform the action,
  other than by deputisation, if e held the office;

  3. either (i) a time limit by which the rules require the action
  to be performed has expired or (ii) the office is vacant.

  4. either (i) the office is vacant, (ii) the aforementioned time
  limit expired more than fourteen days ago, or (iii) the deputy
  announced between two and fourteen days earlier that e intended to
  deputise for that office for the purposes of the particular
  action.

  5. the deputy, when performing the action, announces that e is
  doing so by deputisation.

  When a player deputises for an elected office, e becomes the
  holder of that office, unless the action being performed would
  already install someone into that office.

    A requirement to perform an action, for the purposes of this
    rule, can be a logical implication from rules and circumstances,
    not just directly imposed by the rules. In particular, it is
    possible to deputise to rotate the bench.

    Deputisation is generally treated as if the deputy gained the
    office immediately before the action, and lost it immediately
    after.
