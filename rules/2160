  A rule which purports to allow a person (a deputy) to perform an
  action via normal deputisation or special deputisation for an
  office thereby allows them to perform the action as if e held the
  office, as long as

  1. it would be POSSIBLE for the deputy to perform the action,
     other than by deputisation, if e held the office, and

  2. the deputy, when performing the action, announces that e
     is doing so by the appropriate form of deputisation.

  Only this rule may allow normal deputisation. Any rule may allow
  special deputisation.

  A player CAN perform an action as if e held a particular office,
  via normal deputisation, if all of the following are true:

  1. The rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of
     holding that office, to perform the action. This requirement is
     fulfilled by the deputy performing the action.

  2. Either (i) A time limit by which the rules require the action
     to be performed has expired or (ii) the office is vacant.

  3. Either (i) the office is vacant; or (ii) the aforementioned
     time limit expired more than fourteen days ago; or (iii) the
     deputy announced between two and fourteen days earlier that e
     intended to deputise for that office for the purposes of the
     particular action.

  When a player deputises via normal deputisation for an elected
  office, e becomes the holder of that office, unless the action
  being performed would already install someone into that office.

    A requirement to perform an action, for the purposes of this
    rule, can be a logical implication from rules and circumstances,
    not just directly imposed by the rules. In particular, it is
    possible to deputise to rotate the bench.

    Deputisation is generally treated as if the deputy gained the
    office immediately before the action, and lost it immediately
    after.
