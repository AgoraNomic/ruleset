        obviously unsuited to the conduct which constitutes the reason
        for its levy or to the person on whom it is being levied;
  
    (5) it attempts to levy a fine (i) by summary judgement more than
        14 days after the action constituting the reason for the fine
        or (ii) based upon the investigation of of a Finger that had
        been Pointed more than 14 days after the action constituting
        the reason for the fine;
  
    (6) it attempts to levy a fine on a player for failing to take an
        action within the time period set by the Rules and that time
        period had expired (i) more than 14 days prior to the
        attempted fine, if the attempted fine is imposed by summary
        judgement or (ii) more than 14 days prior to the Pointed
        Finger, if the fine is imposed based on an investigation of
        such Finger;
  
    (7) it attempts to levy a fine on a player who has already been
        fined for the conduct constituting the reason for the levy; or
  
    (8) it attempts to levy a fine on a zombie for an action that its
        master performed on its behalf.
  
    If the Referee attempts to levy three or more INEFFECTIVE fines in
    a week, any player CAN, with two support, issue a writ of
    Impartial Arbitration Restoration, immediately making the position
    of Referee vacant. When a writ of Impartial Arbitration
    Restoration is issued, the ADoP SHALL initiate an election for the
    Referee within a timely fashion.
