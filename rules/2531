  Any attempt to levy a fine is INEFFECTIVE if it does not include
  (1) value of the fine in blots, (2) the name of the person being
  fined (the perp), and (3) the specific reason for the fine, or if
  it attempts to levy a fine on a person for an action or inaction
  which e (more likely than not) did not commit, or if it attempts
  to levy a fine for an action or inaction which is not prohibited
  by law, or if it attempts to levy a fine with a value which is
  blatantly and obviously unsuited to the conduct which constitutes
  the reason for its levy or to the person to which it is being
  levied, or if it is made more than 14 days after the conduct
  constituting the reason for the fine, or if it attempts to levy a
  fine to a player who has already been levied a fine for the
  conduct constituting the reason for the levy.

  If the Referee attempts to levy three or more INEFFECTIVE fines in
  a week, any player CAN, with two support, issue a writ of
  Impartial Arbitration Restoration, immediately making the position
  of Referee vacant. When a writ of Impartial Arbitration
  Restoration is issued, the ADoP SHALL initiate an election for the
  Referee within a timely fashion.
