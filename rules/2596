  Any player CAN perform The Ritual by paying a fee of 7 Coins. The
  Ritual MUST be performed at least once in every Agoran week. If
  The Ritual was performed at least once in the previous Agoran
  week, then the Ruleset is Appeased.

  If the Ruleset is appeased, then any player CAN banish this rule
  (cause it to repeal itself) with N Agoran Consent, where N is the
  maximum of 1.0 and 10/(B+1), rounded up to the nearest 0.1, and B
  is the number of weeks that the Ruleset has been continuously
  appeased at the moment of banishment.
