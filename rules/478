  Freedom of speech being essential for the healthy functioning of
  any non-Imperial nomic, it is hereby resolved that no Player shall
  be prohibited from participating in the Fora, nor shall any person
  create physical or technological obstacles that unduly favor some
  players' fora access over others.

  Publicity is a forum switch with values Public, Discussion, and
  Foreign (default), tracked by the Registrar. Changes to publicity
  are secured.

  The Registrar may change the publicity of a forum without
  objection as long as:

  1. e sends eir announcement of intent to that forum; and

  2. if the forum is to be made public, the announcement by which
     the Registrar makes that forum public is sent to all existing
     public fora.

  Each player should ensure e can receive messages via each public
  forum.

  A public message is a message sent via a public forum, or sent to
  all players and containing a clear designation of intent to be
  public. A rule can also designate that a part of one public
  message is considered a public message in its own right. A person
  "publishes" or "announces" something by sending a public message.

  Where the rules define an action that CAN be performed "by
  announcement", a person performs that action by unambiguously and
  clearly specifying the action and announcing that e performs it.
  Any action performed by sending a message is performed at the time
  date-stamped on that message. Actions in messages (including
  sub-messages) are performed in the order they appear in the
  message, unless otherwise specified.
