  The vote collector for an unresolved Agoran decision CAN resolve
  it by announcement, indicating the outcome.  If it was required
  to be initiated, then e SHALL resolve it in a timely fashion
  after the end of the voting period.  To be valid, this
  announcement must satisfy the following conditions:

  1. It is published after the voting period has ended.

  2. It clearly identifies the matter to be resolved.

  3. It specifies the outcome, as described elsewhere, and, if
     there was more than one valid option, provides a tally of
     the voters' valid ballots.

  Each Agoran decision has exactly one vote collector, defaulting
  to the initiator of the decision.  If the vote collector is
  defined by reference to a position (or, in the default case, if
  the initiator was so defined), then the vote collector is the
  current holder of that position.

  This rule takes precedence over any rule that would provide
  another mechanism by which an Agoran decision may be resolved.

  In general, changes to the gamestate due to the outcome of an
  Agoran decision take effect when the decision is resolved.

    this makes the notice invalid.
