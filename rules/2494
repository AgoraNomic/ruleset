  The Regkeepor is an office, responsible for the maintenance of the
  Regulations. The Regulations are contained in the Regkeepor's
  weekly report, know as the Agora Nomic Code of Regulations
  (ACORN). E MAY publish multiple versions or editions of the ACORN.

  The ACORN is divided into titles, assigned by the Regkeepor, which
  are each given an integer. Generally, each office with the power
  to create regulations SHOULD be assigned the next successive
  natural number. Title 0 of the ACORN is reserved for use by the
  Regkeepor, and nothing in that title need be a regulation.
  Non-regulations printed in the ACORN have no binding effect, and
  SHALL clearly be marked by the Regkeepor.

  Each regulation SHALL be assigned an ID number by the Regkeepor,
  consisting of a string of the characters [0-9] and separator
  characters. The Regkeepor SHOULD establish some way of keeping
  track of the version of a regulations. The Regkeepor MAY also, at
  eir discretion, create ways of marking special types of Regulation
  (even in violation of the previous restrictions of this
  paragraph), mark sections or titles as reserved for future use,
  and make such other discussions of arrangement, annotation, and
  marking as are necessary and proper in the execution of eir
  duties.

  The Regkeepor SHOULD remember that the purpose of the ACORN is to
  make the regulations easily readable, and e SHALL not act in a
  manner intended to deceive others in eir official capacity.
