  An action is restricted if: (1) the Rules limit, allow, enable,
  or permit its performance; (2) describe the circumstances under
  which the action would succeed or fail; or (3) the action would,
  as part of its effect, modify information for which some player
  is required to be a recordkeepor.

  A Restricted Action CAN only be performed as described by the Rules, and only
  using the methods explicitly specified in the Rules for performing the given
  action.  The Rules SHALL NOT be interpreted so as to proscribe
  unrestricted actions.
