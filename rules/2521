  Each contract has an associated set of persons, known as the
  parties. The person who creates a contract is automatically a
  party. Other persons CAN become parties to a contract by
  announcement if the contract's text permits them to do so. Parties
  can leave a contract by announcement, ceasing being parties, if
  the contract's text permits them to do so. A contract CAN expel a
  party or group of parties by announcement, causing them to cease
  being parties.

  It is IMPOSSIBLE, by any means, for a person to become a party to
  a contract, for an contract to be created with a person as a
  party, or for an entity to become a contract with a person as a
  party, without that person's consent. This rule takes precedence
  over any rule that might make such a change
  possible.
