  A conditional vote on an Agoran decision is a vote which indicates
  a vote based on some condition(s). A conditional vote is evaluated
  at the end of the voting period and, rules to the contrary
  notwithstanding, is clearly specified if and only if the value of
  the condition(s) is/are determinate at the end of the voting
  period. If the conditional is clearly specified, and evaluates to
  a valid vote, it is counted as that vote; otherwise, it is counted
  as PRESENT.

  Any vote which is clearly expressed as a conditional, e.g. "FOR if
  <X> is true, AGAINST otherwise", is a valid conditional vote that
  evaluates as specified.

  A vote endorsing another person is equivalent to a conditional
  vote evaluating to the vote specified in that person's valid
  ballot on the decision, if any.

  For an instant runoff decision, a vote consisting of a list, one
  or more entries of which are valid conditional votes, and the
  remaining entries of which are valid options, is a valid
  conditional vote. Such a vote is evaluated by evaluating each
  conditional entry to a list of votes (or an empty list, if it
  evaluates to PRESENT either directly or indirectly), and then
  concatenating those lists with the specified valid options in the
  order they occurred in the original vote.
