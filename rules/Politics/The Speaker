  The Speaker is an imposed office and the figurehead leader of
  Agora.

  The player or players who have most recently won the game are
  called Laureled. If at any time the office of Speaker is vacant,
  or when one or more players win Agora, then the Prime Minister
  CAN and SHALL, once and in a timely fashion, appoint a Laureled
  player to the office of Speaker.

  If the office of Speaker has been held continuously by the same
  person for 90+ days, then any player CAN appoint another player
  to the office with Support.

  For an election of the Prime Minister, the Speaker has voting
  strength one greater than e would have if e did not hold the
  office.
