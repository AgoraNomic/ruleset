  Officeholder is an office switch tracked by the ADoP, with
  possible values of any person or "vacant".  An officer is the
  holder of an office, who may be referred to by the name of that
  office.  If the holder of an office is ever not a player, it
  becomes vacant.

  An imposed office is an office described as such by the rule
  defining it.  All others are elected.  A person CANNOT be made
  the holder of an elected office without eir explicit or
  reasonably implied consent.

  The holder of an elected office CAN resign it by announcement,
  causing it to become vacant. Any player CAN cause an office to
  become vacant without 2 objections.

  text: This rule does not define the meaning of the term "office", in the sense meant
    by Rule 754, but rather references the usual English definition of "office" and
    governs offices as thus defined.

  text: A requirement to submit something to an officer is satisfied by publishing
    it, even if that office is vacant at the time.
