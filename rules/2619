  When the rules authorize an investigator to issue an Indictment
  for a violation, e CAN do so by announcement, specifying a fine of
  blots to be issued and the perpetrator and making an argument for
  the conviction of the accused.

  When an investigator has issued an Indictment, the perpetrator CAN
  state a defence. Within 10 days but no less than 4 days after the
  indictment has been issued, the judge SHALL initiate two Agoran
  Decisions, one to determine whether to convict the perpetrator and
  one to determine whether to accept the indictment. For these
  decision, the vote collector is the Judge and the voting method is
  AI-majority with AI=1.5. When initiating the decisions, the Judge
  SHALL, in the same message, publish the full texts of the
  Indictment and the defence. If both decisions are resolved as
  ADOPTED, the investigator CAN and SHALL impose the fine stated in
  the indictment. If the decision to convict is resolved as ADOPTED
  but the decision to accept is resolved as REJECTED, the
  investigator CAN issue a new Indictment. If the decision to
  convict is resolved as REJECTED, a fine SHALL NOT be imposed for
  the crime stated in the indictment.

  The Judge of the Indictment is the first of the following players
  who is neither the investigator nor the perp: the Arbitor, the
  Speaker, the Prime Minister. If this still fails to specify a
  player, then the Indictment lacks a Judge until that changes.
