  A currency is a class of asset defined as such by its backing
  document. Instances of a currency with the same owner are
  fungible.

  The "x balance of an entity", where x is a currency, is the number
  of x that entity possesses. Where it resolves ambiguity, the asset
  or currency being referred to is the currency designated as
  the official currency of Agora, if there is one.
