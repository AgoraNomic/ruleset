  In a timely fashion after the beginning of each Quarter, the
  Herald CAN and SHALL by announcement, perform the following tasks
  in order:

  1. Halve (rounding towards 0) the Karma of every Unregistered
     person.

  2. Set the Karma of Agora such that the sum of all Karma switch
     instance values in the game is equal to 0.

  While the Karma of Agora is not equal to 0, the Herald CAN and
  SHALL publish a Notice of Honour specifying Agora as a gainer or
  loser in place of a player; to be valid, it must be specified such
  that the result would move the Karma of Agora closer to 0. For
  selection players in such transactions, the Herald SHOULD use
  standards of behavior and game balance befitting the spirit of the
  game.
