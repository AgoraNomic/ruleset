  A person authorized to bid on an Auction CAN do so by
  announcement, specifying the amount of the Auction's currency to
  bid. A bid placed on an Auction before it is initiated, or after
  it has ended, is INEFFECTIVE.

  An attempt to place a bid which is less than the Auction's minimum
  bid is INEFFECTIVE.

  A person CAN withdraw their bid on an Auction by announcement. If
  a person submits a bid on an Auction, all bids previously placed
  on that Auction by that person are withdrawn.

  A rule defining an Auction CAN specify a class of players who are
  authorized to bid on that Auction. If the rule  does not specify a
  class of authorized bidders, any player is authorized to bid on an
  Auction defined by a rule.

  A person SHALL NOT bid on an Auction if it would be impossible for
  em to pay that amount at the conclusion of the Auction.
