  A Tournament is a sub-game of Agora specifically sanctioned
  to be initiated as a tournament by the Rules.  If a winner of a
  tournament is determined within 4 weeks of its initiation, that
  person or persons win the game, otherwise the tournament
  concludes with no winner.

  In a timely fashion after the start of June 1 of each year,
  the Herald SHALL propose a set of Regulations governing a
  Birthday Tournament for that year; the Herald CAN also
  delegate the responsibility for creating or running the
  tournament to another player, with that player's consent.

  The Birthday Tournament's regulations SHOULD be such that all
  persons who choose to participate have a fair chance of winning
  the tournament (according to its regulations), and a winner
  SHOULD be expected within 2-3 weeks following the tournament's
  initiation.

  After adequate time for discussion of the Birthday Tournament's
  regulations, the Herald (or delegate) CAN initiate a sanctioned
  tournament with a specified, finalized set of regulations,
  Without 3 Objections.  The initiation SHOULD be timed to
  coincide with Agora's Birthday.
