  Any player can issue a Trust Token to another person by
  announcement.

  When the Assessor resolves a Decision to adopt a proposal, then
  any player who cast a valid vote on the Decision and was
  endorsed by another player's valid vote on the Decision is
  issued a Trust Token by the endorsing player.

  A person can win the game by announcement if e has been issued a
  Trust Token by each player except emself; if no person has won
  via this mechanism in the past; and if in the same message, e
  quotes, for each of those players, a public message in which
  that player issued em a Trust Token.
