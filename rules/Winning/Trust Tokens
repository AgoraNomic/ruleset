  Any player can issue a Trust Token to another person by
  announcement.

  any player who cast a valid vote on the Decision and was
  endorsed by another player's valid vote on the Decision is
  issued a Trust Token by the endorsing player.

  Trust Token by each player except emself; if no person has won
  via this mechanism in the past; and if in the same message, e
  quotes, for each of those players, a public message in which
  that player issued em a Trust Token.
