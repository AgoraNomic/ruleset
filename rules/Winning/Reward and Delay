  ais523 CAN Declare a Junta by announcement, specifying one or more
  players. Upon doing so, the specified players win the game.

  ais523 CAN Declare an Honour by announcement, specifying a player and a
  patent title. Upon doing so, ais523 is authorized to, and CAN, award
  that player that patent title.

  ais523 CAN Declare an Amendment by announcement, specifying a proposal.
  Upon doing so, that proposal's imminence flips to "pending".

  A proposal's imminence cannot flip by any mechanism except for the
  mechanism specified in this rule, unless a player announced intent to
  cause that proposal's imminence to flip at a time that was:
      a) 21 to 28 days in the past, and
      b) subsequent to the proposal's addition to the Proposal Pool.
  This takes precedence over all rules of power 3 and below that allow
  for a proposal's imminence to be changed.

  Players other than ais523 CANNOT flip a proposal's imminence to
  "pending" via any means, unless they announced intent to do so at least
  21 days in advance. This takes precedence over any rule which would
  allow a player to change a proposal's imminence.
