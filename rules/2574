  Any player CAN, with Notice, flip the master switch of an active
  player who has not made a public announcement in the past 60 days
  to Agora.

  Resale is a secured natural switch for zombies, tracked by the
  Registrar, with a default value of 2. Whenever a zombie's master
  switch is flipped to a player other than emself, eir resale value
  is decreased by 1.

  flipped to a player other than emself, rules to the contrary
  notwithstanding.

    - If a zombie has been a zombie for the past 90 days and not had
     Agora for a master during any of that time, flip the zombie's
     master switch to Agora;
    - If a player is master to more than one zombie, flip the master
     switch of one of that master's zombies to Agora;
    - Deregister a zombie whose master is Agora and who has a Resale
     value of 0.

  The Registrar SHALL track the date that each zombie last belonged
  to Agora in eir weekly report.  The Registrar SHALL perform all
  POSSIBLE actions in the preceding paragraph in a timely fashion
  after first reporting their possibility via the facts in eir
  weekly report.
