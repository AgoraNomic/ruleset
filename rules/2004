  Every Agoran Week, if the number of Units of Private Land is less
  than one half the total number of units of Land, a number of
  Public, non-Aether, Preserved Land Units are chosen using the
  following process:

  1. If there exist more than 5 such units, the Cartographor SHALL
     choose exactly 5 of them.

  2. If there exist 5 or fewer such units, all are automatically
     chosen.

  For each land unit selected by the process described above, the
  Cartographor CAN and SHALL initiate an auction with it as the only
  lot. For this auction, the announcer is the Cartographor, the
  auctioneer is Agora, the minimum bid is 1 coin, and the authorized
  bidders are all active players.
  
  When a land auction ends, all bids by the winner of that auction
  on other land auctions are withdrawn.
