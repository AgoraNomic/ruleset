  The voting strength of an entity on an Agoran decision is an
  integer between 0 and 5 inclusive, defined by rules of power 2
  or greater. If not otherwise specified, the voting strength of
  an entity on an Agoran decision is 1.

  When multiple rules set or modify an entity's voting strength on
  an Agoran decision, it shall be determined by first applying the
  rule(s) which set it to a specific value, using the ordinary
  precedence of rules, and then applying the rules, other than
  this one, which modify it, in numerical order by ID. Finally, if
  theresult of the calculation is not an integer, it is rounded
  up, and then if it is outside the allowable range of values for
  voting strength, it is set to the the minimum value if it was
  less and the maximum value if it was more.
