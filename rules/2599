   The Editor is the same person, if any, as the Rulekeepor.

   The Editor CAN, with Agoran consent, enact regulations,
   collectively called "Editorial Guidelines". The Editor CAN, with
   Agoran consent, repeal and amend Editorial Guidelines. The Editor
   is the Promulgator for all Editorial Guidelines.

   Editorial Guidelines SHOULD pertain only to matters that affect
   non-substantive aspects of the Rules, e.g. capitalization or
   spelling. Editorial Guidelines CANNOT place any enforceable
   requirements upon any player and CANNOT cause any changes to the
   gamestate. Whether or not the text of a textual entity conforms to
   the Editorial Guidelines SHOULD NOT affect the interpretation of
   that entity.

   When writing proposals and enacting or amending regulations,
   players SHOULD follow all reasonable directives that are set out
   in the Editorial Guidelines.

   Causing an Editorial Guideline to be inconsistent with any other
   Editorial Guideline is the Class 1 Crime of Editorial Hypocrisy.
