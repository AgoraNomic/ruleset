  When facilities create assets, the assets are added to the
  facility's possession. The rule that creates a facility CAN
  specify a carrying capacity for assets. If, at any time, the
  amount of an asset in the possession of a facility exceeds that
  asset's carrying capacity, an amount of that asset is destroyed
  until the amount of that asset in the possession of the facility
  is equal to its carrying capacity.

  Each facility is either a production facility or processing
  facility, to be specified in the rule that creates them. At the
  end of every Agoran Week, Agora creates a number of assets in a
  production facility specified by the rule which creates the
  facility.

  At the end of every Agoran Week, Agora destroys any refinable
  assets in the possession of each processing facility that that
  facility can change into refinable assets and replaces them with a
  corresponding number of refined assets to be specified by the rule
  that creates the facility.

  A player can take a number of assets from a facility's inventory
  by announcement if eir location is the same as the facility's and
  the following criteria are met:

  1. if the facility is built on Public Land, none.

  2. if the facility is built on Communal Land, e must be a party to
     that contract and the text of the contract must permit em to do
     so.

  3. if the facility is built on Private Land, e must own the
     facility, or the owner must have consented.
