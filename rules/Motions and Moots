  If a CFJ (1) has a judgement that has been in effect for less
  than seven days and not been appealed, and (2) has not had a
  Motion to Reconsider filed for it at any time while it has been
  assigned to its current judge, then any Player CAN file a Motion
  to Reconsider the case with 2 Support, or by announcement if e
  is that case's judge.  When a Motion to Reconsider is so filed,
  the case is rendered open again.

  If a CFJ has a judgement assigned, a player CAN enter that
  judgement into Moot with two support.  When this occurs, the CFJ
  is suspended, and the Arbitor is once authorized to initiate the
  Agoran decision to determine public confidence in the judgement,
  which e SHALL do in a timely fashion.

  For this decision, the vote collector is the Arbitor and the
  valid options are AFFIRM, REMAND, and REMIT.  When the decision
  is resolved, the effect depends on the outcome:

  - AFFIRM, FAILED QUORUM: The judgement is reassigned to the case,
    and cannot be entered into Moot again.

  - REMAND: The case becomes open again.

  - REMIT: The case becomes open again, and the current judge is
    recused.  The Arbitor SHALL NOT assign em to the case again
    unless no other eligible judges have displayed interest in
    judging.
