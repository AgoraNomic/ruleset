  An asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner by announcement,
  subject to modification by its backing document. An indestructible
  asset is one defined as such by it backing document, and CANNOT be
  destroyed except by a proposal or rule, other than this one,
  specifically addressing the destruction of indestructible assets
  or that asset in particular; any other asset is destructible.

  To "lose" an asset is to have it destroyed from one's possession;
  to "revoke" an asset from an entity is to destroy it from that
  entity's possession.

  An asset generally CAN be transferred (syn. given) by announcement
  by its owner to another entity, subject to modification by its
  backing document. A fixed asset is one defined as such by its
  backing document, and CANNOT be transferred; any other asset is
  liquid.

  When a rule indicates transferring an amount that is not a natural
  number, the specified amount is rounded up to the nearest natural
  number.
