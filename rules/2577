  An asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner by announcement,
  subject to modification by its backing document. An indestructible
  asset is one defined as such by its backing document, and CANNOT
  be destroyed except as explicitly specified by its backing
  document; any other asset is destructible.

  For an entity to earn an asset is for that asset to be created in
  that entity's possession. To grant an entity an asset is to create
  it in eir possession.

  For an entity to lose an asset is for that asset to be destroyed
  from that entity's possession. To revoke an asset from an entity
  is to destroy it from that entity's possession.

  For entity A to take an asset from entity B is to transfer it from
  entity B to entity A.
  
  An asset generally CAN be transferred (syn. given) by announcement
  by its owner to another entity, subject to modification by its
  backing document. A fixed asset is one defined as such by its
  backing document, and CANNOT be transferred; any other asset is
  liquid.

  When a rule indicates transferring an amount that is not a natural
  number, the specified amount is rounded up to the nearest natural
  number.
