  Any person (the initiator) can initiate a Call for Judgement (CFJ,
  syn. Judicial Case), specifying a statement to be inquired into:

  a) by announcement, and spending 1 Action Point, OR

  b) by announcement, and spending the current CFJ cost in shinies,
     OR

  c) by announcement if e is not a player.

  When a person initiates a Call for Judgment, e CAN optionally bar
  one person from the case by announcement.

  At any time, each CFJ is either open (default), suspended, or
  assigned exactly one judgement.

  The Arbitor is an office, responsible for the administration of
  justice in a manner that is fair for emself, if not for the rest
  of Agora.

  When a CFJ has no judge assigned, the Arbitor CAN assign any
  player to be its judge by announcement, and SHALL do so within a
  week.  The players eligible to be assigned as judge are all
  players except the initiator and the person barred (if any). The
  Arbitor SHALL assign judges over time such that all interested
  players have reasonably equal opportunities to judge. If a CFJ has
  no judge assigned, then any player eligible to judge that CFJ CAN
  assign it to emself Without 3 Objections.

  The Arbitor's weekly report includes a summary of recent judicial
  case activity, including open and recently-judged cases, recent
  judicial assignments, and a list of players interested in judging.
