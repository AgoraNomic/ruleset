  Any person (the initiator) can initiate a Call for Judgement (CFJ,
  syn. Judicial Case), specifying a statement to be inquired into:

    a) by announcement, and spending 1 Action Point, OR

    b) by announcement, and spending 1/20th the Floating Value in
    shinies, OR

    c) by announcement if e is not a player.

  When a person initiates a Call for Judgment, e may optionally bar one
  person from the case.

  At any time, each CFJ is either open (default), suspended, or
  assigned exactly one judgement.

  The Arbitor is an office, responsible for the administration of
  justice in a manner that is fair for emself, if not for the rest
  of Agora.

  When a CFJ has no judge assigned, the Arbitor CAN assign any
  player to be its judge by announcement, and SHALL do so within a
  week.  The players eligible to be assigned as judge are all
  players except the initiator and the person barred (if any).
  The Arbitor SHALL assign judges over time such that all
  interested players have reasonably equal opportunities to judge.
  If a CFJ has no judge assigned, then any player eligible to
  judge that CFJ CAN assign it to emself Without 3 Objections.
