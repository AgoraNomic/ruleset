  Each Estate has a Farm switch, tracked by the Agronomist, with values
  "farmed" and "unfarmed", defaulting to "unfarmed". Changes to Farm
  switches are secured. An Estate whose Farm switch is "farmed" is a Farm,
  and its owner is the Farmer of that Estate.

  In the first week of an Agoran month, the owner of an unfarmed Estate MAY
  flip its Farm switch to "farmed" by announcement, if e pays Agora a number
  of shinies equal to the Farm Rate.

  In the first week of an Agoran month, the owner of a Farm MAY till the
  farm by announcement, if e pays Agora a number of shinies equal to the
  Farm Rate. If the Farmer of an Estate does not till it within the first
  week of an Agoran month, the Agronomist CAN flip its Farm switch to
  "unfarmed" by announcement, and SHALL do so in a timely fashion.

  When an Estate is transferred to Agora or to an Organization, its Farm
  switch is set to "unfarmed" immediately afterwards
