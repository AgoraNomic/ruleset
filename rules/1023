  The following terms are defined:

  1. The phrase "in a timely fashion" means "within 7 days". This
     time period is set when the requirement is created (i.e. X days
     before the limit ends). A requirement to perform an action at
     an exact instant (e.g. "when X, Y SHALL Z"), but not "in the
     same message", is instead interpreted as a requirement to
     perform that action in a timely fashion after that instant.

  2. Agoran epochs:

       1. Agoran days begin at midnight UTC.

       2. Agoran weeks begin at midnight UTC on Monday.

       3. Agoran months begin at midnight UTC on the first day of
          each Gregorian month.

       4. Agoran quarters begin when the Agoran months of January,
          April, July, and October begin.

       5. Agoran years begin when the Agoran month of January
          begins.

       6. A pivot is either the instant at which Agora Nomic began
          (June 30, 1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200) or an instant at which
          at least one person won the game. When used as a period of
          time, a "Round" (historical syn: "game") is the period of
          time between a pivot and the next pivot.

     These definitions do not apply to relative durations (e.g.
     "within <number> days after <event>").

  3. Two points in time are within a month of each other if:

      1. they occur in the same Agoran month;

      2. they occur in two consecutive Agoran months, and the later
         of the two occurs in an earlier day in the month than the
         earlier one;

      3. they occur in two consecutive Agoran months on the same day
         of the month, and the later of the two occurs at the same
         or earlier time of day.
