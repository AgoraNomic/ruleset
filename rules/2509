  If a switch is defined as being associated with a specified set of
  numbers (a numerical switch), then the possible values for that
  switch are the numbers in that set. In particular, a "natural"
  switch is a switch with possible values of the non-negative
  integers. If a limit is further defined, the possible values are
  the numbers of the set within the specified limits.

  If 0 is in the specified values for a numerical switch and no
  default value is otherwise specified, 0 is the default value for
  that switch.

  If the rules describe mathematical operations to be used in
  flipping an instance of a numerical switch, the operations are
  interpreted as having common-sense mathematical application to
  determine that instance's resulting value. For example,
  "increasing a switch instance by M" is equivalent to "flipping a
  switch instance from its current value N to the value N+M". If the
  specified mathematical operation would result in a value outside
  that switch's defined set, the flipping CANNOT be performed, rules
  to the contrary notwithstanding.
