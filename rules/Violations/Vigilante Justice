  A player CAN by announcement, but subject to the provisions of
  this rule, Point eir Finger at a player, citing an alleged
  violation of the rules by that player.

  When a player Points a Finger, the investigator SHALL
  investigate the allegation and, in a timely fashion, SHALL
  conclude the investigation by:
   - issuing a Card to the pointed-at player by announcement whose
     reason is rooted in the allegation;

   - if e believes that no rules violation occurred or that it
     would be ILLEGAL to issue a Card for it, announcing the
     Finger Pointing to be Shenanigans.

  The Referee is by default the investigator for all Finger
  Pointing.  When a Finger, other than the Arbitor's, is Pointed
  over an allegation related to the official duties or powers of
  the Referee, then the Arbitor CAN, by announcement, take over
  the investigation and thereby become the investigator.

  A player CANNOT point a finger more than twice per Agoran week,
  or more than once per Agoran week at the same player.
