  Each Agoran decision has a voting method, which must be
  AI-majority, instant runoff, or first-past-the-post. The voting
  method is that specified by the authorizing authority, or
  first-past-the-post by default.

  Each Agoran decision has a set of valid options (the choices that
  the voters are being asked to select from) and valid votes (the
  ways in which the voters can express their opinion or lack
  thereof. For AI-majority decisions, the valid options are FOR and
  AGAINST; for other decisions, the valid options are defined by
  other rules.

  The valid votes on an Agoran decision are:

  1. PRESENT;

  2. The valid conditional votes, as defined by rules of power at
     least that of this rule; and

  3. For an instant runoff decision, the ordered lists of entities.

  4. For any other decision, the valid options.
