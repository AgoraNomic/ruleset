  Pledges are an indestructible fixed asset. Ownership of pledges is
  restricted to persons. The Referee is the recordkeepor of pledges.
  Creating, destroying, modifying, and transferring pledges are
  secured.

  To "pledge" something is to create a pledge with those terms. A
  person CAN pledge by announcement to create a pledge e owns.

  To "retract" (syn "withdraw") a pledge is to destroy it. A person
  CAN retract a pledge e owns without objection.

  To "call in" a pledge" is to destroy it. A player CAN call in any
  pledge with Agoran Consent, if e announces a reason the Terms of
  the pledge should be considered broken. Support for an intent to
  call in a pledge is INEFFECTIVE unless the supporting player
  explicitly confirms the reasons that the pledge should be
  considered broken.

  It is ILLEGAL to own a pledge when it is called in.
