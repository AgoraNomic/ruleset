  If a Player makes a clear public pledge (syn. Oath) to perform (or
  refrain from performing) certain actions, then breaking the pledge
  within the pledge's time window is the Class N crime of
  Oathbreaking, where N is 2 unless the pledge explicitly states
  otherwise.  The time window of a pledge is 60 days, unless the
  pledge explicitly states otherwise.

  If breaking the pledge harms specific other parties, the Referee
  SHOULD solicit the opinion of those parties in determining an
  appropriate fine.

  The Notary's Weekly Report includes a copy of all pledges that are
  within their time window, and the dates the pledges were made.
