  Agora is ossified if it is IMPOSSIBLE for any reasonable
  combination of actions by players to cause arbitrary rule changes
  to be made and/or arbitrary proposals to be adopted within a
  four-week period.

  If, but for this rule, the net effect of a proposal would cause
  Agora to become ossified, or would cause Agora to cease to exist,
  it cannot take effect, rules to the contrary notwithstanding. If
  any other single change or inseperable group of changes to the
  gamestate would cause Agora to become ossified, or would cause
  Agora to cease to exist, it is cancelled and does not occur, rules
  to the contrary notwithstanding.
