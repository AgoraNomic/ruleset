  Master is a secured player switch with possible values of any
  player, and Agora. Every player's default master is emself; rules
  to the contrary notwithstanding, a player CAN always flip eir own
  master to emself by announcement.

  A player whose master is not emself is a zombie (syn. inactive);
  all other players are active.  A zombie's master, if another
  player, is allowed to act on behalf of the zombie (i.e. as the
  zombie's agent), except a master CANNOT act on behalf of a zombie
  to:
    - initiate, support, object to, or perform a dependent action;
    - act on behalf of that zombie's zombies;
    - bid in a zombie auction;
    - enter a contract, pledge, or other type of agreement;
    - initiate a Call fo Judgement;
    - deregister.

  A zombie's master CAN flip that zombie's master switch to Agora by
  announcement.

  If a master causes a zombie to perform an ILLEGAL action, the
  master commits the Class 4+N Crime of Masterminding (where N is
  the class of the illegal action).

  If a active player who was a zombie has not received a Welcome
  Package since e most recently ceased being a zombie, and if eir
  resale value was less than 2 at any point during eir most recent
  time as a zombie, then any player CAN cause em to receive a
  Welcome Package by announcement.
