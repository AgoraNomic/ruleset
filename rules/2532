  Master is a secured player switch with possible values of any
  player, and Agora. Every player's default master is emself; rules
  to the contrary notwithstanding, a player CAN always flip eir own
  master to emself by announcement.

  A player whose master is not emself is a Zombie. A zombie's
  master, if another player, is allowed to act on behalf of the
  zombie (i.e. as the zombie's agent) to perform LEGAL actions.

  If a player has not made a public announcement in the past 60
  days, then any player CAN flip that player's master to Agora by
  announcement.

  Each zombie whose master is another player has an untracked switch
  indicating whether the zombie Owes a Scare to Agora, with values
  FALSE (default) and TRUE. All such switches are flipped to TRUE at
  the beginning of each month. A zombie's master CAN flip that
  zombie's switch to FALSE by causing the zombie to perform a scary
  public action for the announced purpose of satisfying this scare
  debt. If that switch for a given zombie is TRUE at the end of a
  month, then within the next seven days any player can flip that
  zombie's master to Agora by announcement.

  This switch is of course the zombie's Boo Lien switch.
