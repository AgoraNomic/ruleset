  Medals of Honour are a destructible fixed currency tracked by the
  Herald.

  In the first 7 days of an Agoran month, any player CAN declare
  emself to be eligible for a Medal of Honour by announcement if all
  of the following are true:

  * E has made at least 1 message to a public forum in the last
    Agoran month.

  * Eir Karma is not below -3.

  * In the last Agoran month, e has not had a Card issued to em.

  In the first 7 days of an Agoran month after the first 7 days, if
  there are any players who are eligible for a Medal of Honour, the
  Herald CAN, by announcement, initiate an Agoran Decision on who is
  to be awarded a Medal of Honour. E SHALL do so within the 7 days
  of an Agoran month after the first 7 days. For this decision, the
  valid votes are all players who are eligible for a Medal of
  Honour, the vote collector is the Herald, and the voting method is
  instant-runoff. Upon the resolution of this decision, the Herald
  CAN, and SHALL in a  timely fashion, award the outcome of the
  decision a Medal of Honour by  announcement. After a player is
  awarded a Medal of Honour, all players who were previously
  eligible for a Medal of Honour become no longer eligible.

  If, at any time, any player has 6 or more Medals of Honour, and e
  has not won via this rule previously, e can win the game by
  announcement, destroying all of eir Medals of Honour.
