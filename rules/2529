  Medals of Honour are a destructible fixed currency tracked by the
  Herald.

  In the first Eastman week of an Agoran month, any player CAN
  declare emself to be eligible for a Medal of Honour by
  announcement if all of the following are true:

  * E has made at least 1 message to a public forum in the last
    Agoran month.

  * Eir Karma is not below -3.

  * In the last Agoran month, e has not had a fine levied on em.

  In the second Eastman week of an Agoran month, if there are any
  players who are eligible for a Medal of Honour, the Herald CAN, by
  announcement, initiate an Agoran Decision on who is to be awarded
  a Medal of Honour. E SHALL do so within the second Eastman week of
  that Agoran month. For this decision, the valid votes are all
  players who are eligible for a Medal of Honour, the vote collector
  is the Herald, and the voting method is instant-runoff. Upon the
  resolution of this decision, the Herald CAN, and SHALL in a timely
  fashion, award the outcome of the decision a Medal of Honour by

  no longer eligible.

  If, at any time, any player has 6 or more Medals of Honour, and e
  has not won via this rule previously, e can win the game by
  announcement, destroying all of eir Medals of Honour.
