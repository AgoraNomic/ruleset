  Location is a player switch, tracked by the Cartographer, whose
  values are ordered pairs of integers where the first value is a
  valid Latitude, and the second is a valid Longitude. The default
  Location is (0, 0).

  To "move" a player is to flip that playerâ€™s Location switch to the
  Latitude and Longitude of the destination.

  No other Entity can have a location unless it is defined in a rule
  other than this one. Changes to the Location of an Entity are
  secured. If an Entity is specified by this Rule as having a
  defined Location, but its Location has not been explicitly set or
  changed, its Location is set to (0, 0).
