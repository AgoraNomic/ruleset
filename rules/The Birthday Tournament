   In a timely fashion after the start of June 1 of each year, the
   Herald SHALL propose a set of Regulations governing a Birthday
   Tournament for that year; the Herald CAN also delegate the
   responsibility for creating or running the tournament to another
   player, with that player's consent, by announcement.

   The Birthday Tournament's regulations SHOULD be such that all
   persons who choose to participate have a fair chance of winning
   the tournament (according to its regulations), and a winner
   SHOULD be expected within 2-3 weeks following the tournament's
   initiation.

   After adequate time for discussion of the Birthday Tournament's
   regulations, the Herald (or delegate) CAN initiate a sanctioned
   tournament with a specified, finalized set of regulations,
   Without 3 Objections. By doing so e promulgates those regulations
   as a special temporary title of the ACORN. This title may
   thereafter be amended only by the Herald or eir designee without
   objection, to correct minor typos. The initiation SHOULD be timed
   to coincide with Agora's Birthday.
