  Adoption index is an untracked switch possessed by Agoran
  decisions and proposals, whose value is either "none" (default)
  or an integral multiple of 0.1 from 1.0 to 9.9.

  Adoption index is secured with a power threshold of 2.

  Adoption index is an essential parameter of an Agoran decision
  if that decision has an adoption index.

  For any Agoran decision with an adoption index, the voting
  method is AI-majority.

    "FOR", despite its former private usage with the latter meaning.'
