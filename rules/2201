  A public document defined by the rules as self-ratifying is
  ratified when it is continuously undoubted for one week.

  A doubt is an explicit public challenge via one of the following
  methods, identifying a document and explaining the scope and
  nature of a perceived error in it:

  1. An inquiry case, appropriate for questions of legal
     interpretation.

  2. A claim of error, appropriate for matters of fact. The
     publisher of the original document SHALL (if e was required to
     publish that document) or SHOULD (otherwise) do one of the
     following in a timely fashion:

     1. Deny the claim (causing it to cease to be a doubt).
     2. Publish a revision.
     3. Initiate an inquiry case regarding the truth of the claim
        (if the subject is actually a matter of law), or cite a
        relevant existing inquiry case.

  text: A challenge to a self-ratifying document {at the time of CFJ 1690, the resolution
    of an Agoran decision} must explicitly identify the document, either individually
    or as part of a set, and explicitly contest the accuracy of some aspect of it.

    of all parts of it.
