  When a public document is continuously undoubted for one week
  after publication:

  - If the rules define it as self-ratifying, it is ratified.

  - If the rules define it as a self-ratifying attestation to a
    given statement, the statement is ratified.

    This clause is inapplicable if the statement to be ratified
    cannot be reasonably ascertained from the ruleset and the
    contents of the message.

  A doubt is an explicit public challenge via one of the following
  methods, identifying a document and explaining the scope and
  nature of a perceived error in it (or in a statement it attests
  to):

  1. An inquiry case, appropriate for questions of legal
     interpretation.

  2. A claim of error, appropriate for matters of fact. The
     publisher of the original document SHALL (if e was required to
     publish that document) or SHOULD (otherwise) do one of the
     following in a timely fashion, in an announcement that clearly
     cites the claim of error:

     1. Deny the claim (causing it to cease to be a doubt).

     2. Publish a revision.

     3. Initiate an inquiry case regarding the truth of the claim
        (if the subject is actually a matter of law), or cite a
        relevant existing inquiry case.

    A challenge to a self-ratifying document {at the time of CFJ
    1690, the resolution of an Agoran decision} must explicitly
    identify the document, either individually or as part of a set,
    and explicitly contest the accuracy of some aspect of it.

    A challenge to any part of a self-ratifying document prevents
