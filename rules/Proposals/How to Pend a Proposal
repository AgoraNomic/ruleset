  Imminence is a switch, tracked by the Promotor, possessed by
  proposals in the Proposal Pool, whose value is either "pending"
  or "not pending" (default).

  Pending List Price is an integer switch, tracked by the Promotor,
  whose default value is 5. At the beginning of every month, the
  Pending List Price is set to the mean of the price paid for each
  proposal pended in the previous month, rounded down. If less
  than 2 proposals were pended in the previous month, the Pending
  List Price is set to its default.

  Pending Minimum Price is, at all times, 9/10ths of the Pending
  List Price, rounded down.

  Any player CAN pay Agora a specified amount, which is no less
  than the Pending Minimum Price, to flip a proposal's imminence
  to "pending" Without 3 Objections. If the specified amount is
  less than the Pending Minimum Price, then the attempt to pay is
  INEFFECTIVE, and the proposal's imminence is not flipped.
