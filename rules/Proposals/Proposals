  A proposal is a type of entity consisting of a body of text and
  other attributes.  A player CAN create a proposal by
  announcement, specifying its text and optionally specifying any
  of the following attributes:

  * An associated title.
  * A list of co-authors (which must be persons other than the
    author).
  * An adoption index.

  Creating a proposal adds it to the Proposal Pool.  Once a
  proposal is created, nether its text nor any of the
  aforementioned attributes can be changed.  The author (syn.
  proposer) of a proposal is the person who submitted it.

  If a decision of whether to adopt a proposal was resolved as
  FAILED QUORUM in the last seven days, the Promotor CAN once add
  the proposal back to the Proposal Pool by announcement.

  The author of a proposal in the Proposal Pool CAN remove (syn.
  retract, withdraw) it from the Pool by announcement.

  The Promotor CAN remove a proposal from the Proposal Pool by
  announcement if it is not pending and has been added to the Pool
  more than 14 days ago.

  text: Preceding a proposal-like text with the heading "Proposal:" and a title can
    be sufficient to clearly indicate that it is intended to become a proposal, but
    is not if it can be interpreted as quoting an existing proposal.

  text: Preceding a proposal-like text with the question "What is the title of this
    proposal?" can be sufficient to clearly indicate that it is intended to become
    a proposal.
