name: Adopting Proposals
power: 3
text: |
  When a decision about whether to adopt a proposal is resolved, if
  the outcome is ADOPTED, then the proposal in question is adopted,
  and unless other rules prevent it from taking effect, its power is
  set to the minimum of four and its adoption index, and then it
  takes effect. Except as prohibited by other rules, a proposal that
  takes effect CAN and does, as part of its effect, apply the
  changes that it specifies. If the proposal cannot make some such
  changes, this does not preclude the other changes from taking
  place.

  If there is no Agoran Decision to adopt a particular proposal that
  has an outcome of ADOPTED, that proposal CANNOT take effect, rules
  to the contrary notwithstanding.

  Preventing a proposal from taking effect is a secured change; this
  does not apply to generally preventing changes to specified areas
  of the gamestate, nor to a proposal preventing itself from taking
  effect (its no- effect clause is generally interpreted as applying
  only to the rest of the proposal). Except insofar as the actions
  performed by a proposal happen one after another, rather than
  simultaneously, a proposal's effect is instantaneous. A proposal
  can neither delay nor extend its own effect. Once a propsal
  finishes taking effect, its power is set to 0.

    Where a proposal attempts two separate amendments of the text of
    the same rule, if one of the attempted amendments is not
    possible and the other is then the possible amendment does in
    fact occur, unless the proposal explicitly requires a different
    resolution.
