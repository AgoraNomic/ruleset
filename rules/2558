  When the rules authorize an investigator to impose the Cold Hand
  of Justice for a violation, e CAN do so by levying a fine on the
  perp with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 2x the base value of the
  violation, within the following guidelines:

  - If the violation is described by the rules as a Class N crime,
    then N is the base value; otherwise the base value is 2.

  - The fine SHOULD be reduced to the degree that the violation is a
    minor, accidental, and/or inconsequential infraction.

  - The fine SHOULD be increased to the degree that the violation is
    willful, profitable, egregious, or an abuse of an official
    position.

  Optionally, in the same message in which e imposes justice, the
  investigator CAN specify that the violation is forgivable,
  specifying up to 10 words to be included in an apology.  If the
  investigator does so, the perp CAN, in a timely fashion, expunge P
  blots from emself, where P is the minimum of the value of the fine
  and 3, by publishing a formal apology of at least 200 words and
  including all the specified words, explaining eir error, shame,
  remorse, and ardent desire for self-improvement.
