  In a conflict between Rules, the conflict shall be resolved by
  performing the following comparisons in the sequence written in
  this rule, until the conflict is resolved.

  - In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule
    with the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the
    lower Power; otherwise,

  - If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
    precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
    determining precedence relations, then the determinations of
    the precedence-determining Rule shall be used to resolve the
    conflicts; otherwise,

  - If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
    itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
    takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then
    such provisions shall be used to resolve the conflict, unless
    they lead to contradictions between each other; otherwise,

  - If any of the rules in conflict have ID numbers, then the Rule
    with the lowest ID number takes precedence; otherwise,

  - The Rule enacted earliest takes precedence.

  Clauses in any other rule that broadly claim precedence (e.g.
  over "all rules" of a certain class) shall be, prima facie,
  considered to be limited claims of precedence or deference that
  are applicable only when such claims are evaluated as described
  within the above sequence.

  No change to the Ruleset can occur that would cause a Rule to
  directly claim precedence over this Rule as a means of
  determining precedence.  This applies to changes by the
  enactment or amendment of a Rule, or of any other form.  This
  Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would permit such a
  change to the Ruleset.

  text: The presence in a Rule of deference clause, claiming that the Rule defers
    to another Rule, does not prevent a conflict with the other Rule arising, but
    shows only how the Rule says that conflict is to be resolved when it does arise.

  text: This Rule is to be applied to resolve Rule conflicts on a case-by-case basis;
    just because a Rule is inapplicable in one situation due to conflict with a Rule
    of higher precedence does not mean that the Rule is nullified in all cases.
