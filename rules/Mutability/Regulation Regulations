  An action is regulated if: (1) the Rules limit, allow, enable,
  or permit its performance; (2) describe the circumstances under
  which the action would succeed or fail; or (3) the action would,
  as part of its effect, modify information for which some player
  is required to be a recordkeepor.

  Regulated Actions CAN only be performed as described by the
  Rules.  The Rules SHALL NOT be interpreted so as to proscribe
  unregulated actions.
