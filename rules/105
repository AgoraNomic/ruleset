  Where permitted by other rules, an instrument generally can, as
  part of its effect,

  1. enact a rule. The new rule has power equal to the minimum of
     the power specified by the enacting instrument, defaulting to
     one if the enacting instrument does not specify or if it
     specifies a power less than 0.1, and the maximum power
     permitted by other rules. The enacting instrument may specify a
     title for the new rule, which if present shall prevail. The ID
     number of the new rule cannot be specified by the enacting
     instrument; any attempt to so specify is null and void.

  2. repeal a rule. When a rule is repealed, it ceases to be a rule,
     its power is set to 0, and the Rulekeepor need no longer
     maintain a record of it.

  3. reenact a rule. A repealed rule identified by its most recent
     rule number MUST be reenacted with the same ID number and the
     next change identifier. If no text is specified, the rule is
     reenacted with the same text it had when it was most recently
     repealed. If the reenacting proposal provides new text for the
     rule, the rule must have materially the same purpose as did the
     repealed version; otherwise, the attempt to reenact the rule is
     null and void. Unless specified otherwise by the re-enacting
     instrument, a re-enacted rule has power equal to the power it
     had at the time of its repeal (or power 1, if power was not
     defined at the time of that rule's repeal). If the re-enacting
     instrument is incapable of setting the re-enacted rule's power
     to that value, then the re-enactment is null and void.

  4. amend the text of a rule.

  5. retitle a rule.

  6. change the power of a rule.

  A rule change is any effect that falls into the above classes.
  Rule changes always occur sequentially, never simultaneously.

  Any ambiguity in the specification of a rule change causes that
  change to be void and without effect. An inconsequential variation
  in the quotation of an existing rule does not constitute ambiguity
  for the purposes of this rule, but any other variation does.

  A rule change is wholly prevented from taking effect unless its
  full text was published, along with an unambiguous and clear
  specification of the method to be used for changing the rule, at
  least 4 days and no more than 60 days before it would otherwise
  take effect.

  This rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be
  created, modified, or destroyed, or by which an entity can become
  a rule or cease to be a rule.

    If a low-power rule states that an officer can repeal the rule
    under certain circumstances, then the rule cannot actually be
    repealed by this process, because the officer, not being an
    instrument, is categorically incapable of performing rule
    changes; this is different from the situation where a rule can
    be triggered to repeal itself.
