  The following terms are defined.  These definitions are used
  when a rule includes a term in all caps, and provide guidance in
  determining the ordinary-language meaning of a term when a rule
  includes a term otherwise.  Earlier definitions take precedence
  over later ones.  If a rule specifies one or more persons in
  connection with a term, then the term applies only to the
  specified person(s).

  1. CANNOT, IMPOSSIBLE, INEFFECTIVE, INVALID:  Attempts to
     perform the described action are unsuccessful.

  2. MUST NOT, MAY NOT, SHALL NOT, ILLEGAL, PROHIBITED: Performing
     the described action violates the rule in question.

  3. NEED NOT, OPTIONAL:  Failing to perform the described action
     does not violate the rules.

  4. SHOULD NOT, DISCOURAGED, DEPRECATED:  Before performing the
     described action, the full implications of performing it
     should be understood and carefully weighed.

  5. CAN: Attempts to perform the described action are successful.

  6. MAY: Performing the described action does not violate the
     rules.

  7. MUST, SHALL, REQUIRED, MANDATORY:  Failing to perform the
     described action violates the rule in question.

  8. SHOULD, ENCOURAGED, RECOMMENDED:  Before failing to perform
     the described action, the full implications of failing to
     perform it should (in the ordinary-language sense) be
     understood and carefully weighed.
