  Any player CAN, with Agoran Consent, initiate a Proposal
  Competition with a specified Objective. Only one Competition may
  be in progress at a time. The Objective should be a specification
  of effects of a proposal, and SHOULD NOT depend on factors that
  could not be determined from the text of a proposal.

  During the Agoran Week following the initiation of a Proposal
  Competition, any player CAN specify that a Proposal e submits is a
  Competition Proposal for that Competition. Players are ENCOURAGED
  to describe how their Competition Proposals fulfill the Objective.

  The Promotor SHALL distribute all Competition Proposals for a
  given Competition in the same message. The Assessor SHALL resolve
  all the Agoran Decisions to adopt the Competition Proposals for a
  given Competition in the same message.

  Once all Agoran decisions to adopt Competition Proposals for a
  given Competition have been resolved, the Competition ends.
