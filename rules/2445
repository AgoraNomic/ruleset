name: How to Pend a Proposal
power: 1
text: |
  Imminence is a switch, tracked by the Promotor, possessed by
  proposals in the Proposal Pool, whose value is either "pending" or
  "not pending" (default).

  Any player CAN flip a specified proposal's imminence to "pending"
  by announcement by:

    a) spending 1 Action Point, OR

    b) spending the current Pend Cost in shinies.

  An Official Proposal is a proposal designated as such by the
  Rules; generally official proposals that are created as part of an
  Officer's duties. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, an
  Official proposal is always pending. Rules to the contrary
  notwithstanding, players CANNOT claim rewards for the adoption of
  an Official proposal.
