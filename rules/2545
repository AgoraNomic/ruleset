  An Auction is a way for entities to give away items in exchange
  for a currency. Any rule CAN permit or require Auctions to be
  initiated.

  Each Auction has one or more lots of items. A lot is a non-empty
  list of items to be transferred to a single recipient.

  Each Auction has an Auctioneer. All rules permitting Auctions to
  be initiated should specify an entity to be Auctioneer. If no
  Auctioneer is specified, the default Auctioneer is Agora.

  Each Auction has an Announcer. Only persons can be Announcers. If
  the Auctioneer of an Auction is a player, then that player is also
  the Announcer of that Auction. Otherwise, the rule defining an
  Auction CAN define the Announcer for that Auction.
