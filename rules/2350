  A proposal is a type of entity consisting of a body of text and
  other attributes. A player CAN create a proposal by announcement,
  specifying its text and optionally specifying any of the following
  attributes:

  * An associated title.

  * A list of co-authors (which must be persons other than the
    author).

  * An adoption index.

  Creating a proposal adds it to the Proposal Pool. Once a proposal
  is created, nether its text nor any of the aforementioned
  attributes can be changed. The author (syn. proposer) of a
  proposal is the person who submitted it.

  If a decision of whether to adopt a proposal was resolved as
  FAILED QUORUM in the last seven days, the Promotor CAN once add
  the proposal back to the Proposal Pool by announcement.

  The author of a proposal in the Proposal Pool CAN remove (syn.
  retract, withdraw) it from the Pool by announcement.

  The Promotor CAN remove a proposal from the Proposal Pool by
  announcement if it is not pending and has been added to the Pool
  more than 14 days ago.

    Preceding a proposal-like text with the heading "Proposal:" and
    a title can be sufficient to clearly indicate that it is
    intended to become a proposal, but is not if it can be
    interpreted as quoting an existing proposal.

    Preceding a proposal-like text with the question "What is the
