  If a rule says that a contract CAN do something by announcement,
  it is equivalent to saying that that any person CAN take that
  action by announcement if the contract's text says that e CAN do
  so under the circumstances; if whether the contract enables the
  person to do so is indeterminate, or is the subject of an
  inextricable conditional, the action is IMPOSSIBLE. A person SHALL
  NOT cause a contract to violate a rule using this method.

  If a rule specifies that a contract SHALL or SHALL NOT do
  something, each party to the contract SHALL ensure that the
  contract respectively does or does not do that thing.

  The text of a contract can permit persons to act on behalf of a
  party or group of parties. To do so, it must specify:

  a. Which of its parties can be acted on behalf of;

  b. What actions can be taken;

  c. Who can take the actions; and

  d. Any conditions or limitations upon the actions. If any such
     limitations or conditions are inextricable, the actions CANNOT
     be used.
