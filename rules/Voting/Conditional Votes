  If a vote on an Agoran decision is submitted conditionally (e.g.
  "FOR if <X> is true, otherwise AGAINST"), then the selected
  option is evaluated based on the value of the condition(s) at
  the end of the voting period, and, rules to the contrary
  notwithstanding, is clearly specified if and only if the value
  of the condition(s) is/are determinate at the end of the voting
  period.  If the option cannot be clearly identified, a vote of
  PRESENT is cast.

  Casting a vote endorsing another voter is equivalent to
  conditionally casting a vote whose value is the same as the most
  common value (if any) among that voter's valid votes on that
  decision.

  Casting a vote denouncing another voter is equivalent to
  conditionally casting a vote whose value is opposite to the most
  common value (if any) among that voter's valid votes on that
  decision.  FOR and AGAINST are opposites.
