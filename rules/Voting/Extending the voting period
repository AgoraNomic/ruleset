  Whenever the voting period of an Agoran decision would end, and
  the result would be FAILED QUORUM, the length of the voting
  period for that decision is instead increased to 14 days, except
  if it is already that length, provided this has not already
  happened for the decision in question.

  Upon such an occurrence, the vote collector for the decision
  SHALL issue a humiliating public reminder to the slackers who
  have not yet cast any votes on it despite being eligible, and
  CAN end its voting period by announcement (resolving it
  constitutes an implicit announcement that its voting period is
  first ended) if the result would no longer be FAILED QUORUM, or
  if the decision is whether to adopt a proposal and no voter
  (other than possibly the proposal's author) has voted FOR.
