  The Notary is an office.

  The Notary's weekly report contains:

  1. every pledge, along with its title, creator, time window, time
     of creation, and time of expiry; and
  2. every contract, with its title, full provisions, and parties.

  If the Notary is required to report a title, but none has been
  otherwise publicly provided, e CAN select one.

  The transitional period lasts for at least 90 days after this rule
  comes into force; thereafter, any player CAN end it by announcement.
  A pledge or contract is invisible if it was created before this rule
  came into force, and has not been publicly posted since this rule
  came into force; for a contract, this publication must include its
  full provisions and list of parties, along with a certification or
  adequate proof of their accuracy and completeness. During the
  transitional period, the Notary NEED NOT report any invisible
  contract or pledge. When the transitional period is ended, each
  invisible contract or pledge ceases to exist in the order they were
  created, and then this rule amends itself by deleting this paragraph.
