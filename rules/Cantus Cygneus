  Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously
  by the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part
  of it, e may submit a document to the Registrar, clearly labeled
  a Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and expressing eir
  reproach for those who e feels have treated em so badly.

  In a timely fashion after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the
  Registrar shall publish this document along with a Writ of
  Fugiendae Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione, commanding the
  Player to be deregistered. The Registrar shall note the method
  of deregistration for that Player in subsequent Registrar
  Reports.

  The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and
  the notation in the Registrar's Report will ensure that,
  henceforth, all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of
  FAGE.

    grievances, etc. is not a Cantus Cygneus.
