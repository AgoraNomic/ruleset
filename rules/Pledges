    Pledges are an indestructible fixed asset. Ownership of pledges
    is restricted to persons. The Referee is the recordkeepor of
    pledges. Creating, destroying, modifying, and transferring
    pledges are secured.

    To "pledge" something is to create a pledge with those terms. A
    person CAN pledge by announcement to create a pledge e owns.

    To "retract" (syn "withdraw") a pledge is to destroy it. A
    person CAN retract a pledge e owns without objection.

    To "call in" a pledge" is to destroy it. A player CAN call in
    any pledge with Agoran Consent, if e announces a reason the
    Terms of the pledge should be considered broken. Support for an
    intent to call in a pledge is INEFFECTIVE unless the supporting
    player explicitly confirms the reasons that the pledge should
    be considered broken.

    It is ILLEGAL to own a pledge when it is called in.
