  Where permitted by other rules, an instrument generally can,
  as part of its effect,

  1. enact a rule.  The new rule has power equal to the minimum
     of the power specified by the enacting instrument,
     defaulting to one if the enacting instrument does not
     specify or if it specifies a power less than 0.1, and the
     maximum power permitted by other rules.  The enacting
     instrument may specify a title for the new rule, which if
     present shall prevail.  The ID number of the new rule cannot
     be specified by the enacting instrument; any attempt to so
     specify is null and void.

  2. repeal a rule.  When a rule is repealed, it ceases to be a
     rule, and the Rulekeepor need no longer maintain a record
     of it.

  3. reenact a rule.  A repealed rule identified by its most
     recent rule number may be reenacted with the same ID number
     and the next change identifier.  If no text is specified,
     the rule is reenacted with the same text it had when it was
     most recently repealed.  If the reenacting proposal provides
     new text for the rule, the rule must have materially the
     same purpose as did the repealed version; otherwise, the
     attempt to reenact the rule is null and void.

  4. amend the text of a rule.

  5. retitle a rule.

  6. change the power of a rule.

  A rule change is any effect that falls into the above classes.
  Rule changes always occur sequentially, never simultaneously.

  Any ambiguity in the specification of a rule change causes that
  change to be void and without effect.  An inconsequential
  variation in the quotation of an existing rule does not
  constitute ambiguity for the purposes of this rule, but any
  other variation does.

  A rule change is wholly prevented from taking effect unless its
  full text was published, along with an unambiguous and clear
  specification of the method to be used for changing the rule, at
  least 4 days and no more than 60 days before it would otherwise
  take effect.

  This rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be
  created, modified, or destroyed, or by which an entity can
  become a rule or cease to be a rule.

  text: If a low-power rule states that an officer can repeal the rule under certain
    circumstances, then the rule cannot actually be repealed by this process, because
    the officer, not being an instrument, is categorically incapable of performing
    rule changes; this is different from the situation where a rule can be triggered
    to repeal itself.

  text: Where a proposal specifies a rule to amend by both number and title, and the
    number and title given identify different rules, this constitutes ambiguity that
    nullifies the attempted rule change.

  text: Where a proposal contains the form of words "Change the power of rule NNNN
    to P and amend it by XXX.", where XXX specifies a text change, this constitutes
    two attempted rule changes.

  text: Where a proposal contains the form of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX.  Amend
