  A Comestible is a type of liquid asset, which can be owned by
  players. Creating Comestibles is secured. The recordkeepor of
  Comestibles is the Agronomist.

  The Farmer of an Estate CAN offer Comestibles by announcement,
  naming a number of Comestibles offered and a price per Comestible
  in Shinies. A player CANNOT offer more Comestibles in a month than
  10 times the number of Farms e owns. The Farmer is ENCOURAGED to
  name the kind of Comestibles on offer after a plant, vegetable,
  grain, livestock, or other farm good.

  A player other than the offering Farmer CAN accept a Comestibles
  offer by announcement to create that number of Comestibles in eir
  possession, by paying the offering Farmer the price per Comestible
  named in the offer times the number of Comestbiles offered. The
  Value of a Comestible created this way is equal to the price per
  Comestible offered by the Farmer.

  An offer expires at the end of the Agoran month in which it is
  made. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, an offer CANNOT be
  accepted if it has expired.

  During an Agoran Decision, a player CAN increase their voting
  strength on that decision by destroying (syn. "eating",
  "consuming") Comestibles. Eir voting strength is increased by
  one-tenth the total Value of the Comestibles destroyed this way,
  rounded down, to a maximum of 5.

  A Comestible is an Expired Comestible if it was created by
  accepting an offer announced more than three Agoran months ago. An
  Expired Comestible CANNOT be consumed to increase voting strength,
  and CAN be destroyed by any player, by announcement. The Agronomist
  SHALL destroy all Expired Comestibles at the start of each Agoran
  month.
