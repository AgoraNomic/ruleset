  The first Agoran week each year which falls entirely in February
  is Read the Ruleset Week. Agorans are encouraged to read the
  ruleset during Read the Ruleset Week.

  The above notwithstanding, due to serious uncertainty surrounding
  the state of the rules during the scheduled Read the Ruleset Week,
  in the year 2020, Read the Ruleset Week is, instead, the week of
  February 24 - March 1
