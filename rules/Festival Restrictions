  While Agora's Festivity is nonzero, the following apply:

  1. Non-Festive players are never considered Supporters of a
     dependent action;

  2. Non-Festive players cannot flip the Imminence of any
     proposal;

  3. Quorum for Agoran Decisions is equal to half the number of
     Festive players, rounded up;

  4. Each Festive player has the maximum possible voting
     strength. All other players have the minimum possible voting
     strength.

  While Agora's Festivity is zero, the paragraphs above have no
