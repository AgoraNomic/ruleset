  The following terms are defined:

  1. The phrase "in a timely fashion" means "within 7 days".
     This time period is set when the requirement is created
     (i.e. X days before the limit ends).  A requirement to
     perform an action at an exact instant (e.g.  "when X, Y
     SHALL Z"), but not "in the same message", is instead
     interpreted as a requirement to perform that action in a
     timely fashion after that instant.

  2. Agoran epochs:

      1. Agoran days begin at midnight UTC.

      2. Agoran weeks begin at midnight UTC on Monday.

      3. Agoran months begin at midnight UTC on the first day of
         each Gregorian month.

      4. Agoran quarters begin when the Agoran months of January,
         April, July, and October begin.

      5. Agoran years begin when the Agoran month of January
         begins.

      6. A pivot is either the instant at which Agora Nomic began
         (June 30, 1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200) or an instant at
         which at least one person won the game.  When used as a
         period of time, a "Round" (historical syn: "game") is
         the period of time between a pivot and the next pivot.

      These definitions do not apply to relative durations (e.g.
      "within <number> days after <event>").

  3. If a restricted value, or the value of a conditional, or a
     value otherwise required to determine the outcome of a
     restricted action, CANNOT be reasonably determined (without
     circularity or paradox) from information reasonably
     available, or if it alternates instantaneously and
     indefinitely between values, then the value is considered to
     be Indeterminate, otherwise it is Determinate.

  4. Two points in time are within a month of each other if:

      1. they occur in the same Agoran month;

      2. they occur in two consecutive Agoran months, and the
         later of the two occurs in an earlier day in the month
         than the earlier one;

      3. they occur in two consecutive Agoran months on the same
         day of the month, and the later of the two occurs at the
         same or earlier time of day.
