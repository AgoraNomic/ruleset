  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no entity with power below
  the power of this rule can

  1. cause an entity to have power greater than its own.

  2. adjust the power of an statute with power greater than its
     own.

  3. set or modify any other substantive aspect of an instrument
     with power greater than its own except as otherwise provided
     in this rule. A "substantive" aspect of an statute is any
     aspect that affects the statute's operation.

  An ephemeral instrument is bound by prohibitions and limitations
  specified in rules of lower power, unless it explicitly overrides
  those prohibition(s) as provided for in other rules.
