  A player CAN by announcement, but subject to the provisions of
  this rule, Point eir Finger at a person (the perp) who plays the
  game, citing an alleged violation of the rules by that person.

  When a player Points a Finger, the investigator SHALL investigate
  the allegation and CAN, and in a timely fashion SHALL, conclude
  the investigation by:

  - Imposing the Cold Hand of Justice on the perp, as described
    elsewhere; or

  - if e believes that no rules violation occurred or that it would
    be ILLEGAL or INEFFECTIVE to levy a fine for it, announcing the
    Finger Pointing to be Shenanigans.

  The above notwithstanding, the investigator CANNOT resolve a
  Finger Pointing for which e is the perp.

  The Referee is by default the investigator for all Finger
  Pointing. If the Referee is the perp, then the Arbitor CAN
  become the investigator of that Finger Pointing by announcement.

  The Referee CANNOT Point eir Finger. The Arbitor CANNOT Point eir
  Finger at the Referee.
