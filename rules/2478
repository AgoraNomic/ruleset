  A player CAN by announcement, but subject to the provisions of
  this rule, Point eir Finger at a person who plays the game, citing
  an alleged violation of the rules by that person.

  When a player Points a Finger, the investigator SHALL investigate
  the allegation and, in a timely fashion, SHALL conclude the
  investigation by:

  - Imposing the Cold Hand of Justice, issuing a Card to the
    pointed-at person by announcement whose reason is rooted in the
    allegation; or

  - if e believes that no rules violation occurred or that it would
    be ILLEGAL to issue a Card for it, announcing the Finger
    Pointing to be Shenanigans.

  There is no limit on how many times a player may impose the Cold
  Hand of Justice per week

  The Referee is by default the investigator for all Finger
  Pointing. When a Finger, other than the Arbitor's, is Pointed over
  an allegation related to the official duties or powers of the
  Referee, then the Arbitor CAN, by announcement, take over the
  investigation and thereby become the investigator.
  
  The Referee CANNOT Point eir Finger. The Arbitor CANNOT Point eir
  Finger at the Referee
