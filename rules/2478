  this rule, Point eir Finger at a person (the perp) who plays the

  When a player Points a Finger, the investigator SHALL investigate
  the allegation and CAN, in a timely fashion, SHALL conclude the
  investigation by:

  an allegation related to the official duties or powers of the
  Referee, then the Arbitor CAN, by announcement, take over the
  investigation and thereby become the investigator.

  The Referee CANNOT Point eir Finger. The Arbitor CANNOT Point eir
  Finger at the Referee.
