  A player CAN by announcement, but subject to the provisions of
  this rule, Point eir Finger at a person who plays the game, citing
  an alleged violation of the rules by that person.

  When a player Points a Finger, the investigator SHALL investigate
  the allegation and, in a timely fashion, SHALL conclude the
  investigation by:

  - issuing a Card to the pointed-at person by announcement whose
    reason is rooted in the allegation; or

  - if e believes that no rules violation occurred or that it would
    be ILLEGAL to issue a Card for it, announcing the Finger
    Pointing to be Shenanigans.

  The Referee is by default the investigator for all Finger
  Pointing. When a Finger, other than the Arbitor's, is Pointed over
  an allegation related to the official duties or powers of the
  Referee, then the Arbitor CAN, by announcement, take over the
  investigation and thereby become the investigator.

  A player CANNOT point a finger more than twice per Agoran week, or
  more than once per Agoran week at the same person.
