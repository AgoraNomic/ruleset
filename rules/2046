  Q*Bert is an entity which has a location. Q*Bert CAN be on a unit
  of Aether.

  Q*Bert has a color switch, tracked by the Cartographor, whose
  possible values are all defined Land Type other than Aether or
  Gray. The default value is Black. When Q*Bert moves to a Land
  Unit, if the current type of the unit is not the same as Q*Bert's
  color switch, Q*Bert changes that space's type to the value of eir
  color switch.

  Every week, the Cartographor CAN and SHALL move Q*Bert using the
  following process:

  1. If Q*Bert is on the same Land Unit as another entity, the
     Cartographor SHALL select a Land Unit adjacent to Q*Bert's
     current position and move em there.

  2. Otherwise, the Cartographor SHALL select a Land Unit whose
     longitude and latitude both differ from Q*Bert's by exactly
     one.

  If, after Q*Bert has moved, e is on a Preserved Land Unit, the
  Cartographor SHALL repeat the process above, moving Q*Bert until e
  is no longer on a Preserved Land Unit.

  If the type of the Land Unit that Q*Bert is located on is
  switched by an entity that is not Q*Bert, Q*Bert's color switch is
  set to that type instead.

  Whenever Q*Bert is moved to (0, 0), the Cartographor CAN and SHALL
  choose a random Land Type that is an allowed value of Q*Bert's
  color switch and set Q*Bert's color switch to it.

  When referring to Q*Bert, entities CAN replace the "*" with any
  punctuation character or spell it with a lowercase letter "b"
  (i.e. Q-Bert, Q^bert)
