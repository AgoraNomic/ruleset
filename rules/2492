  A judge CAN recuse emself from a CFJ they are assigned to by
  announcement.

  When a judge recuses emself from a CFJ the following happens:

  1 - The CFJ becomes unassigned

  2 - The recused judge becomes ineligible to be assigned as a judge
      for a week.

  3 - The recused judge SHOULD suggest another judge for the CFJ to
      make the Arbitor's job easier.
