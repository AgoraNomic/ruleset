  A player CAN initiate an election for a specified elected office:

  a) with 2 support, if either the office is interim or the most
     recent election for that office was resolved more than 90 days
     prior, and provided that the initiator becomes a candidate in
     the same message.

  b) By announcement, if e is the ADoP and if the office is interim,
     or if e is the holder of that office.

  The above notwithstanding, an election for an office CANNOT be
  initiated if one is already in progress.

  When an election is initiated, it enters the nomination period,
  which lasts for 4 days. After an election is initiated and until
  nominations close, any player CAN become a candidate by
  announcement. A candidate ceases to be a candidate if e ceases to
  be a player during the election or if holding the office would
  make em Overpowered. During the nomination period, a candidate CAN
  cease to be a candidate by announcement if there is at least one
  other candidate.

  An election whose nomination period is complete is contested if it
  has two or more candidates, and uncontested otherwise. Nominations
  close at the end of the poll's voting period or when the election
  is ended, whichever comes first.

  After the nomination period ends, the ADoP CAN and, in a timely
  fashion, SHALL:

  1) If the election is contested, initiate an Agoran decision to
     select the winner of the election (the poll). For this
     decision, the Vote Collector is the ADoP, the valid options are
     the candidates for that election (including those who become
     candidates after its initiation), and the voting method is
     instant runoff. When the poll is resolved, its outcome, if a
     player, wins the election. If the outcome is not a player, the
     election ends with no winner.

  2) If POSSIBLE per the following paragraph, end the election
     immediately.

  If at any point an uncontested election has a single candidate,
  then any player CAN by announcement declare em the winner of the
  election, thereby causing em to win the election. If at any point
  an uncontested election has no candidates, then any player CAN
  declare the election ended with no winner by announcement.

  When a player wins an election, e is installed into the associated
  office and the election ends.
