  A player CAN initiate an election for a specified office:

  a) With 2 Support, if either the office is interim or the most
     recent election for that office was resolved more than 90 days
     prior, and provided that the initiator becomes a candidate in
     the same message.

  b) By announcement, if e is the ADoP and if the office is interim,
     or if e is the holder of that office.

  The above notwithstanding, an election for an office CANNOT be
  initiated if one is already in progress.

  After an election is initiated and until nominations close, any
  player CAN become a candidate by announcement. A candidate ceases
  to be a candidate if e ceases to be a player during the election.
  An election is contested if it has two or more candidates at the
  end of the nomination period, and uncontested otherwise. For a
  contested election, nominations close at the end of the poll's
  voting period. For an uncontested election, nominations close at
  the end of the nomination period.

  When an election is initiated, it enters the nomination period,
  which lasts for 7 days. In a timely fashion after the nomination
  period ends, the ADoP CAN and SHALL, in the same message:

  1) If the election is contested, initiate an Agoran decision
     to select the winner of the election (the poll). For this
     decision, the Vote Collector is the Assessor, the valid
     options are the candidates for that election (including
     those who become candidates after its initiation), and the
     voting method is instant runoff.

  2) Distribute all pending Campaign Proposals associated with the
     election.

  3) If POSSIBLE per the following paragraph, end the election
     immediately.

  If at any point an uncontested election has a single candidate,
  and that candidate either is not the author of a Committed
  Campaign Proposal for that election or that proposal was adopted,
  then any player CAN declare them the winner of the election by
  announcement. If at any point an uncontested election has no
  candidates, or a single candidate who is the author of a failed
  Committed Campaign Proposal for that election, then any player CAN
  declare the election ended with no winner by announcement. The
  Assessor SHALL do one or the other in the same message in which e
  resolves a decision to adopt a Campaign Proposal for an ongoing
  uncontested election.

  A poll CANNOT be resolved until the decisions to adopt all
  associated Campaign Proposals are resolved. When resolving the
  poll, if a given candidate authored one of the associated Campaign
  Proposals, that proposal is Committed, and it was not adopted,
  then that player is disqualified.

  When the poll is resolved, its outcome, if a player, wins the
  election. When a player wins an election, e is installed into the
  associated office and the election ends.
