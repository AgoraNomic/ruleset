  A conditional is any textual structure that attempts to make a statement (the
  substrate) affecting any part or aspect of the gamestate, or the
  permissibility, possibility, or effect of any action affecting such a part or
  aspect, dependent on the truth value or other state of a textual structure
  (the condition). The condition is said to be "affixed" to the substrate
  (inverse "to be conditional upon").

  A condition is inextricable if it is unclear, ambiguous, circular,
  inconsistent, paradoxical, depends on information that is indeterminate, or
  is impossible or unreasonably difficult to determine, or otherwise requires an
  unreasonable effort to resolve; otherwise it is extricable. A conditional is
  inextricable if its condition is inextricable; otherwise it is extricable. A
  player SHOULD NOT use an inextricable conditional for any purpose.

  An action is said to be "subject to" a conditional if its possibility,
  permissibility, or effect (depending on context) is determined by the
  conditional. A value is said to be subject to a conditional of the state
  of the value is determined by the conditional.
