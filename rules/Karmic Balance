  In a timely fashion after the beginning of each Quarter, the
  Herald CAN and SHALL by announcement, perform the following tasks
  in order:

  1.  Halve (rounding towards 0) the Karma of every
      Unregistered person.

  2.  Set the Karma of the Community Chest such that the sum
      of all Karma switch instance values in the game is
      equal to 0.

  While the Karma of the Community Chest is not equal to 0, the
  Herald CAN and SHALL publish a Notice of Honour specifying the
  Community Chest as a gainer or loser in place of a player; to be
  valid, it must be specified such that the result would move the
  Karma of the Community Chest closer to 0.  For selection players
  in such transactions, the Herald SHOULD use standards of behavior
  and game balance befitting the spirit of the game.
