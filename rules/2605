  Interest is an office switch, tracked by the ADoP, whose possible
  values are lists of ministries, defaulting to the empty list. The
  ADoP CAN flip an office's interest without objection.

  For each item of each office's interest, that office's holder's
  voting strength is increased by 2 on proposals whose chamber is
  set to that ministry.
