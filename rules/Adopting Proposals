  When a decision about whether to adopt a proposal is resolved, if the
  outcome is ADOPTED, then the proposal in question is adopted, and unless
  other rules prevent it from taking effect, its power is set to the minimum
  of four and its adoption index, and then it takes effect.Except as
  prohibited by other rules, a proposal that takes effect CAN and does, as
  part of its effect, apply the changes that it specifies.If the proposal
  cannot make some such changes, this does not preclude the other changes
  from taking place.

  If there is no Agoran Decision to adopt a particular proposal that has an
  outcome of ADOPTED, that proposal CANNOT take effect, rules to the
  contrary notwithstanding.

  Preventing a proposal from taking effect is a secured change; this does
  not apply to generally preventing changes to specified areas of the
  gamestate, nor to a proposal preventing itself from taking effect (its no-
  effect clause is generally interpreted as applying only to the rest of the
  proposal).
