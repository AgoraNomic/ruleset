  Chamber is a a secured untracked ordinary proposal switch whose
  possible values include unset (the default) and each of the
  ministries of Agora.

  A proposal's chamber SHOULD only be decided by which ministry's
  goals it effects to the greatest degree.

  If the chamber of an ordinary proposal in the Proposal Pool is
  unset, the Promotor CAN set the chamber to a specified ministry
  by announcement. Any player CAN, with 2 Agoran consent, flip
  the chamber of an ordinary proposal to any ministry, provided
  that it is in the Proposal Pool or that there is an Agoran
  decision on its adoption whose voting period has not yet ended.

  To refer a proposal to a ministry is to set the chamber of that
  proposal to the specified ministry.
