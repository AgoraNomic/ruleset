  Agora is ossified if it is IMPOSSIBLE for any reasonable combination of
  actions by players to cause arbitrary rule changes to be made and/or
  arbitrary proposals to be adopted within a four-week period.

  If, but for this rule, the net effect of a proposal would cause Agora to
  become ossified, or would cause Agora to cease to exist, it cannot take
  effect, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.If any other single change
  to the gamestate would cause Agora to become ossified, or would cause
  Agora to cease to exist, it is cancelled and does not occur, rules to the
  contrary notwithstanding.
