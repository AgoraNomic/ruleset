  A type of switch is a property that the rules define as a
  switch, and specify the following:

  1. The type(s) of entity possessing an instance of that switch.
     No other entity possesses an instance of that switch.

  2. One or more possible values for instances of that switch,
     exactly one of which is designated as the default.  No other
     values are possible for instances of that switch.

  3. Optionally, exactly one office whose holder tracks instances
     of that switch.  That officer's (weekly, if not specified
     otherwise) report includes the value of each instance of that
     switch whose value is not its default value; a public
     document purporting to be this portion of that officer's
     report is self-ratifying, and implies that other instances
     are at their default value.

  At any given time, each instance of a switch has exactly one
  possible value for that type of switch.  If an instance of a
  switch comes to have a value, it ceases to have any other value.
  If an instance of a switch would otherwise fail to have a
  possible value, it comes to have its default value.

  "To flip an instance of a switch" is to make it come to have a
  given value.  "To become X" (where X is a possible value of
  exactly one of the subject's switches) is to flip that switch to
  X.

  If an action or set of actions would cause the value of an
  instance of a switch to become indeterminate, the instance
  instead takes on its last determinate and possible value, if
  any, otherwise it takes on its default value.

  A natural switch is a switch with a default value of 0, unless
  the rules explicitly specify a different default value.  If the
  rules define an upper limit for the switch, then the possible
  values are non-negative integers not greater than that limit,
  otherwise the values are the non-negative integers.

  A singleton switch is a switch for which Agora Nomic is the only
  entity possessing an instance of that switch.

  A boolean switch is a switch with values True and False. A
  positive boolean switch has a default of True; a negative
  boolean switch has a default of False.
