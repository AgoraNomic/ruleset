  An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
  initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
  to initiate the decision.  This notice is invalid if it lacks
  any of the following information, and the lack is correctly
  identified within one week after the notice is published:

  (a) The matter to be decided (for example, "the adoption of
      proposal 4781").

  (b) A clear indication of the set of valid votes.

  (c) The identity of the vote collector.

  (d) Any additional information defined by the rules as essential
      parameters.

  The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting
  period for the decision.  The voting period lasts for 7 days.
  The minimum voting period for a decision with at least two
  options is five days.  The vote collector for a decision with
  less than two options CAN and SHALL end the voting period by
  announcement, if it has not ended already, and provided that e
  resolves the decision in the same message.

  The voting period for a decision cannot be set or changed to a
  duration longer than fourteen days.

    text: If the notice does not mention voter eligibility but the type of Agoran
      decision is clear and the rule defining the relevant type of Agoran decision
      fully determines the class of eligible voters, then the notice thereby implicitly
      describes the class of eligible voters.

      over any information that would be implicit, even where the explicit information
      is inaccurate and the implicit information would have been accurate.

    text: If a R107 notice initiating an Agoran decision does not contain an explicit
      list of the eligible voters, and there is later a dispute (evidenced by submission
      of a CFJ) over which voters were eligible at that time, then the notice's description
      of the class of eligible voters was necessarily insufficient to enable public
      agreement on which persons are eligible.
