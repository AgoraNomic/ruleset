  Agora, each player, and each organization have corresponding
  switches known as Balance switches. Each Balance switch's
  possible values are integers. Agora's Balance's default value is
  1000. Each player and organization's Balance's default value is
  0. Balances are tracked by the Secretary. The unit for Balance
  values is shiny (pl. shinies).

  If Agora, a player, or an organization (A) 'pays' X shinies to
  Agora, a player, or an organization (B), A's Balance is
  decreased by X and B's Balance is increased by X. Any attempt to
  pay a negative amount is INEFFECTIVE, rules to the contrary
  notwithstanding.

  Any player CAN pay Agora, any other player, or any organization
  any amount by announcement, unless it would make eir own balance
  negative. Any attempt to PAY any amount that would make any
  player's or any organization's balance negative is INEFFECTIVE,
  rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

  Any organization CAN pay Agora, any player, or any other
  organization by announcement by a member of said organization,
  as specified in the charter of said organization, unless it
  would make the organization's balance negative. Any attempt by
  any player to cause an organization to pay any amount that would
  make that organization's balance negative is INEFFECTIVE, rules
  to the contrary notwithstanding.
