  "Heir" is a person switch, tracked by the Registrar, whose value
  is either empty or the name of a player or Organization. Each
  person's Heir is empty by default. A player may flip eir Heir by
  announcement.

  When a player is deregistered, if eir Heir switch is not empty,
  e automatically pays all of eir Balance to the named player or
  Organization, and transfers all of eir Estates to the named
  player or Organization. Otherwise, if eir Heir switch is empty,
  e may specify another player, an Organization, or Agora, and pay
  all of eir Balance and transfer all of eir Estates to the
  specified player or Organization. If the player does not do so
  within 1 day of deregistration, the Registrar CAN and SHALL
  cause that player to pay eir Balance to Agora and to transfer
  all of eir Estates to Agora, by announcement.
