  An asset is an entity defined as such by a (a) rule, (b) authorized
  regulation, (c) group of rules and/or authorized regulations (but if such
  regulations modify a preexisting asset class defined by a rule or another
  title of regulations, they must be authorized specifically to do so by their
  parent rule), or (d) contract (hereafter its backing document), and existing
  solely because its backing document defines its existence. An asset's backing
  document can specify when and how that asset is created, destroyed, and
  transferred.

  Each asset has exactly one owner. If an asset would otherwise
  lack an owner, it is owned by Agora.  If an asset's backing document restricts
  its ownership to a class of entities, then that asset CANNOT be gained by or
  transferred to an entity outside that class, and is destroyed if it is owned
  by an entity outside that class (except if it is owned by Agora, in which case
  any player CAN transfer or destroy it without objection). The restrictions in
  the previous sentence are subject to modification by its backing document.

  Unless modified by an asset's backing document, ownership of an asset is
  restricted to Agora, players, and contracts. As an exception to the last
  sentence, non-player persons are generally able to own assets defined by
  a contract they are a party to, subject to modification by the contract in
  question.

  A contract's text can specify whether or not that contract is
  willing to receive assets or a class of assets. Generally, a contract CANNOT
  be given assets it is unwilling to receive. If the contract is silent on the
  matter, or if its willingness is indeterminate or the subject of a
  inextricable conditional, the procedure to determine its willingness is as
  follows:

    1. If the contract appears to anticipate being given assets, other than for
       sustenance (e.g. by authorizing parties to spend the contract's assets),
       then the contract is willing to receive all assets.
    2. Otherwise, it is unwilling to receive all assets.

  The previous paragraph (including the list) notwithstanding, a contract
  CAN be given 1 shiny a month for its sustenance payment, so long as
  it never has more than 1 shiny at a time.

  The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity (if any)
  defined as such by, and bound by, its backing document. That
  entity's report includes a list of all instances of that class
  and their owners.  This portion of that entity's report is
  self-ratifying. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a contract CANNOT
  oblige a person who isn't a member to record its internal state, nor is
  the default recordkeepor responsible for tracking a contract's internal state.
  For the purposes of this rule, the promulgator of a regulation is bound by
  it.

  An asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner by
  announcement, subject to modification by its backing document. An
  indestructible asset is one defined as such by it backing document, and CANNOT
  be destroyed except by a rule, other than this one, specifically addressing
  the destruction of indestructible assets or that asset in particular; any
  other asset is destructible. In circumstances where another asset would be
  destroyed, an indestructible asset is generally transferred to Agora, subject
  to modification by its backing document and the intervention of other rules.

  To "lose" an asset is to have it destroyed from one's
  possession; to "revoke" an asset from an entity is to destroy it
  from that entity's possession.

  An asset generally CAN be transferred (syn. paid, given) by announcement by
  its owner to another entity, subject to modification by its
  backing document. A fixed asset is one defined as such by its backing
  document, and CANNOT be transferred; any other asset is liquid.

  When a rule indicates transferring an amount that is not a natural number,
  the specified amount is rounded up to the nearest natural number.

  A currency is a class of asset defined as such by its backing document.
  Instances of a currency with the same owner are fungible.

  The "x balance of an entity", where x is a currency, is the number of x that
  entity possesses. If a rule, proposal, or other competent authority attempts
  to increase or decrease the balance of an entity without specifying a source
  or destination, then the currency is created or destroyed as needed.

  When a player causes one or more balances to change, e is ENCOURAGED
  to specify the resulting balance(s). Players SHOULD NOT specify
  inaccurate balances.

  Where it resolves ambiguity, the asset or currency being referred to is the
  currency designated as "Agora's official currency", if there is one.

  An asset or class of assets is private, rather than public, if its
  backing document is a contract.
