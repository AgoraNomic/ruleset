  Arcadia is a land entirely defined by the Arcadian Map (the Map).
  The Map is the term for the set of all Land Units.

  The Map divides Arcadia into a finite, discrete number of Units of
  Land, or simply Land. Each Unit of Land is an indestructible asset
  specified by an ordered pair of integers known as its Latitude and
  Longitude.

  Every unique ordered pair of integers within the limits defined in
  the Rules for Latitude and Longitude signifies an existent Unit of
  Land. No other Units of Land exist. Units of Land CAN only be
  created or destroyed by changing the limits of Latitude and
  Longitude defined in the Rules.

  All values for Latitude and Longitude MUST lie between -6 and +6,
  inclusive.

  The Total Land Area of Arcadia is the number of existent Units of
  Land defined by permissible Latitude and Longitude pairs.
