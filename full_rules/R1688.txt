Rule 1688/12 (Power=3)
Power

      The Power of an entity is a non-negative rational number. An
      instrument is an entity with positive Power.
      
      The Power of an entity cannot be set or modified except as
      stipulated by the Rules. All entities have Power zero except where
      specifically allowed by the rules.
      
      A Rule that makes a change, action, or value secured (hereafter
      the securing Rule) thereby makes it IMPOSSIBLE to perform that
      change or action, or to set or modify that value, except as
      allowed by an instrument with Power greater than or equal to the
      change's Power Threshold. This Threshold defaults to the securing
      Rule's Power, but CAN be lowered as allowed by that Rule
      (including by the Rule itself).
      
      A Rule that designates the creation of an entity of a given type
      as secured (to a given extent) thereby designates the causing of
      an entity to have that type as secured (to the same extent).
      Similarly, a Rule that designates the destruction of an entity of
      a given type as secured (to a given extent) thereby designates the
      causing of an entity to cease to have that type as secured (to the
      same extent).
