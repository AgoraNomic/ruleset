Rule 106/46 (Power=3)
Adopting Proposals

      When a referendum on a proposal is resolved, if the outcome is
      ADOPTED, then the proposal in question is adopted, its power is
      set to the minimum of four, the adoption index of the proposal,
      and the adoption index of the referendum, and it takes effect.
      Proposals CANNOT otherwise be adopted or take effect, rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding.
      
      When a proposal takes effect, the proposal applies the changes
      that it specifies in its text, except as prohibited by other
      rules. Unless otherwise specified by the text, the effects are
      applied in the order they appear in the text. Clearly marked
      comments are ignored. If the proposal cannot make some changes it
      specifies, that does not preclude the other changes from taking
      place.
      
      Except insofar as the actions performed by a proposal happen one
      after another, rather than simultaneously, a proposal's effect is
      instantaneous. A proposal can neither delay nor extend its own
      effect.  Once a proposal finishes taking effect, its power is set
      to 0.
      
      No entity with power below the power of this rule can prevent a
      proposal from taking effect; this does not apply to generally
      preventing changes to specified areas of the gamestate, nor to a
      proposal preventing itself from taking effect (its no-effect
      clause is generally interpreted as applying only to the rest of
      the proposal).

Annotations:
CFJ 1639 (called 29 Apr 2007): Where a proposal attempts two separate
    amendments of the text of the same rule, if one of the attempted
    amendments is not possible and the other is then the possible
    amendment does in fact occur, unless the proposal explicitly
    requires a different resolution.
CFJ 1841 (called 20 Dec 2007): It is possible for a proposal to have
    retroactive effect.
CFJ 2162 (called 14 Sep 2008): The retroactive effect of a proposal
    cannot actually alter the past.
CFJ 2163 (called 14 Sep 2008): There is no possible proposal text that
    would cause a proposal to take effect without being adopted.
CFJ 2259 (called 06 Nov 2008): The possibility of the instantaneous
    effects of a proposal are governed by the rules.
CFJ 3784 (called 22 Dec 2019): A proposal using the first person refers
    to the proposal itself.
