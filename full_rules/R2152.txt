Rule 2152/11 (Power=3)
Mother, May I?

      The following terms are defined. These definitions are used when a
      rule includes a term in all caps, and provide guidance in
      determining the ordinary-language meaning of a term when a rule
      includes a term otherwise. Earlier definitions take precedence
      over later ones. If a rule specifies one or more persons in
      connection with a term, then the term applies only to the
      specified person(s).

Annotations:
CFJ 1488 (called 11 Feb 2004): Engineering a situation in which other
    players are unable to follow a particular rule is not in itself a
    violation of that rule.
CFJ 2395 (called 01 Mar 2009): Even without this being explicitly
    specified in the rules, it is possible for a non-player to violate a
    rule by missing a deadline.
CFJ 1990 (called 07 Jun 2008): "Allowed" may refer to either possibility
    or permissibility depending on context.
CFJ 2230 (called 16 Oct 2008): In a statement of the form "an action
    that X may take", 'may' generally means 'might', i.e. CAN.
CFJ 2282 (called 19 Nov 2008): To state that an entity "MUST" have
    certain properties refers to possibility, not legality.
CFJ 2414 (called 14 Mar 2009): A rule of the form "X SHOULD be
    interpreted as Y" does not allow players to bypass the
    interpretation by failing to perform the described action.
