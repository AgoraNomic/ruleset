Rule 2463/4 (Power=2)
Motion of No Confidence

      Any player CAN, with Agoran consent, cause the office of Prime
      Minister to become vacant, provided that the message in which e
      does so contains the string "MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE" in its
      subject line. Motions of no confidence SHOULD be used whenever
      Agorans want to shake things up, rather than as a personal
      judgement of the Prime Minister.
