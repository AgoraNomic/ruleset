Rule 2463/3 (Power=2)
Motion of No Confidence

      Any player can cause the office of Prime Minister to become vacant
      with Agoran consent by publishing a message with the character
      string "MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE" in the subject line. Motions of
      confidence SHOULD used whenever Agorans want to shake things up,
      rather than as a personal judgement of the Prime Minister.
