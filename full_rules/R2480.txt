Rule 2480/9 (Power=3.1)
Festivals

      Festivity is a secured singleton switch, whose possible values are
      integers ranging from 0 inclusive to the number of defined types
      of Ribbon exclusive, and defaulting to 0. Festivity is tracked in
      the Tailor's monthly report. In addition, while Festivity is
      non-zero, the Tailor SHALL announce its value each week; a public
      document purporting to be such an announcement is self-ratifying.
      A Festival is ongoing whenever Agora's Festivity is non-zero.
      
      If Agora's Festivity has had the same non-zero value for 14 days
      or more, or if it has a non-zero value and fewer than 5 players
      are Festive, then any player CAN flip it to 0 by announcement.
      
      A Festive person is a person whose Laudability is greater than or
      equal to Agora's Festivity. An N-Festive person is a person who
      would be Festive, were Agora's Festivity N.
      
      For any integer N greater than Agora's Festivity, an N-Festive
      player CAN flip Agora's Festivity to N with 4 support from other
      N-Festive players, unless Agora's Festivity has had a value
      greater than or equal to N in the past 21 days.
