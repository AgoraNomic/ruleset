Rule 105/25 (Power=3)
Rule Changes

      When the rules provide that an instrument takes effect, it can
      generally:
      
      1. enact a rule. The new rule has power equal to the minimum of
         the power specified by the enacting instrument, defaulting to
         one if the enacting instrument does not specify or if it
         specifies a power less than 0.1, and the maximum power
         permitted by other rules. The enacting instrument may specify a
         title for the new rule, which if present shall prevail. The ID
         number of the new rule cannot be specified by the enacting
         instrument; any attempt to so specify is null and void.
      
      2. repeal a rule. When a rule is repealed, it ceases to be a rule,
         its power is set to 0, and the Rulekeepor need no longer
         maintain a record of it.
      
      3. reenact a rule. A repealed rule identified by its most recent
         rule number MUST be reenacted with the same ID number. If no
         text is specified, the rule is reenacted with the same text it
         had when it was most recently repealed. If the reenacting
         proposal provides new text for the rule, the rule SHOULD have
         materially the same purpose as did the repealed version. Unless
         specified otherwise by the reenacting instrument, a reenacted
         rule has power equal to the power it had at the time of its
         repeal (or power 1, if power was not defined at the time of
         that rule's repeal). If the reenacting instrument is incapable
         of setting the reenacted rule's power to that value, then the
         reenactment is null and void.
      
      4. amend the text of a rule.
      
      5. retitle a rule.
      
      6. change the power of a rule.
      
      A rule change is any effect that falls into the above classes.
      Rule changes always occur sequentially, never simultaneously. If a
      specification would ever be interpreted as causing multiple
      changes to happen at once, it is instead interpreted as attempting
      to cause them to occur separately, in the order they are listed in
      the specification.
      
      Any ambiguity in the specification of a rule change causes that
      change to be void and without effect. An inconsequential variation
      in the quotation of an existing rule does not constitute ambiguity
      for the purposes of this rule. Furthermore, if the change being
      specified would be clear to any reasonable player, the
      specification is not ambiguous, even if it is incorrect or unclear
      on its face. This provision does not prevent the specification of
      undesirable changes; for instance, an amendment which adds a typo
      is not corrected to remove the typo.
      
      A rule change is wholly prevented from taking effect unless its
      full text was published, along with an unambiguous and clear
      specification of the method to be used for changing the rule, at
      least 4 days and no more than 60 days before it would otherwise
      take effect.
      
      This rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be
      created, modified, or destroyed, or by which an entity can become
      a rule or cease to be a rule.

Annotations:
CFJ 1499 (called 20 Apr 2004), CFJ 1623 (called 01 Apr 2007): If a
    low-power rule states that an officer can repeal the rule under
    certain circumstances, then the rule cannot actually be repealed by
    this process, because the officer, not being an instrument, is
    categorically incapable of performing rule changes; this is
    different from the situation where a rule can be triggered to repeal
    itself.
CFJ 708 (called between 01 Oct 1994 and 31 Oct 1994): An Amendment of a
    non-existing Rule is not a legal Rule Change.
CFJ 1625 (called 01 Apr 2007): Where a proposal specifies a rule to
    amend by both number and title, and the number and title given
    identify different rules, this constitutes ambiguity that nullifies
    the attempted rule change.
CFJ 1644 (called 29 Apr 2007): Where a proposal contains the form of
    words "Change the power of rule NNNN to P and amend it by XXX.",
    where XXX specifies a text change, this constitutes two attempted
    rule changes.
CFJ 1638 (called 29 Apr 2007): Where a proposal contains the form of
    words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX. Amend rule NNNN by YYY.", this
    constitutes two separate attempts at rule changes, even though both
    attempt to amend the same rule.
CFJ 1642 (called 29 Apr 2007): Where a proposal contains the form of
    words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX. Further amend rule NNNN by YYY.",
    where both XXX and YYY specify text changes, this constitutes two
    separate attempts at rule changes.
CFJ 1640 (called 29 Apr 2007): Where a proposal contains the form of
    words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX and YYY.", where both XXX and YYY
    specify text changes, this constitutes a single attempt at a rule
    change, even though it is specified in two parts.
CFJ 1641 (called 29 Apr 2007): Where a proposal contains the form of
    words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX and by YYY.", where both XXX and YYY
    specify text changes, this constitutes a single attempt at a rule
    change, even though it is specified in two parts.
CFJ 1643 (called 29 Apr 2007): Where a proposal specifies a single rule
    amendment in two parts, and one of the parts is not possible but the
    other is possible, the possible part is applied alone.
CFJ 2201 (called 30 Sep 2008): The permission required by Rule 105 need
    not be explicit.
CFJ 3830 (called 12 Apr 2020): Text in a rule cannot cause a rule-change
    after it has been deleted by an amendment.
