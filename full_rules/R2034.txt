Vote Protection and Cutoff for Challenges

      A public message purporting to resolve an Agoran decision is a
      self-ratifying attestation that
      
      1. such a decision existed,
      
      2. it had the number of voters indicated,
      
      3. it was resolved as indicated, and
      
      4. (if the indicated outcome was to adopt a proposal) such a
         proposal existed, was adopted, and, if it had not
         previously taken effect, took effect.
