Rule 217/12 (Power=3)
Interpreting the Rules

      When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
      takes precedence. Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
      unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense, past
      judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the game.
      
      Definitions and prescriptions in the rules are only to be applied
      using direct, forward reasoning; in particular, an absurdity that
      can be concluded from the assumption that a statement about
      rule-defined concepts is false does not constitute proof that it
      is true. Definitions in lower-powered Rules do not overrule
      common-sense interpretations or common definitions of terms in
      higher-powered rules, but may constructively make reasonable
      clarifications to those definitions. For this purpose, a
      clarification is reasonable if and only if it adds detail without
      changing the underlying general meaning of the term and without
      causing the higher powered rule to be read in a way inconsistent
      with its text.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any rule change that would
      (1) prevent a person from initiating a formal process to resolve
      matters of controversy, in the reasonable expectation that the
      controversy will thereby be resolved; or (2) prevent a person from
      causing formal reconsideration of any judicial determination that
      e should be punished, is wholly void and without effect.

Annotations:
CFJ 1439 (called 20 Feb 2003): A difference in language qualifies as a
    difference in dialect; it is possible to take game actions by
    messages in languages other than English.
CFJ 1460 (called 04 Apr 2003): If a message is in a language other than
    English, and its intended audience does not understand the language,
    this constitutes gross unclarity that makes the message ineffective.
CFJ 712: Referring to a Player by a method other than eir name or
    nickname is acceptable, as long as it is unambiguous.
CFJ 1861 (called 08 Jan 2008): A player's legal name (legal in eir
    country of residence) is not necessarily an acceptable way to refer
    to em.
CFJ 1782 (called 04 Nov 2007): Referring to a player by the name of an
    office that e holds suffices to identify em uniquely as a person, if
    there is no doubt regarding who holds that office.
CFJ 1460 (called 04 Apr 2003): Extremely complex synonyms, requiring
    extensive effort to interpret correctly, can constitute a sufficient
    degree of unclarity as to render the message ineffective.
CFJ 1840 (called 20 Dec 2007): A proper noun that has not been
    explicitly defined does not adequately refer to any entity, and is
    not implicitly defined by the context in which it is used.
CFJ 1580 (called 12 Jan 2006): Base64 encoding of (part of) a message,
    other than in the context of MIME with appropriate headers, can
    render a message ineffective for unclarity, because the decoding
    step requires unreasonable effort within the meaning of CFJ 1460.
CFJ 1741 (called 11 Sep 2007): HTML encoding (including numerical
    character entity encoding) does not render a message ineffective for
    unclarity if a suitable MIME type is indicated by a header.
CFJ 1741 (called 11 Sep 2007): An email message does not need the
    RFC-required "MIME-Version:" header in order for it to be
    interpreted in the MIME way.
CFJ 1770 (called 23 Oct 2007): A contract can redefine a rule-defined
    term in its own way, and the contract's definition will then apply
    in situations governed by the contract.
CFJ 1885 (called 26 Jan 2008): A word or phrase can acquire a meaning by
    custom, provided that it is a reasonable meaning and does not
    unreasonably change the meaning of phrases that already have a
    meaning.
CFJ 1831 (called 10 Dec 2007): Mentioning a URI, without surrounding
    text stating its significance, does not incorporate anything
    identified by that URI into the message that mentions the URI.
CFJ 1831 (called 10 Dec 2007): Character sequences within a URI by
    default have no significance other than their functional role as
    part of the URI.
CFJ 2258 (called 06 Nov 2008): Changes in whitespace are also
    inconsequential.
CFJ 1139: Interpretations {judgements at the time of CFJ 1139} need not
    necessarily accord with the reasoning and arguments of Judges or
    Justices given in past CFJs.
CFJ 3793 (called 16 Jan 2020): The "text of the rules", for the purposes
    of Rule 217, is the text of the rules as actually written, as
    agumented by the  semantic context of applicable definitions.
    Substituting definitions into the text of a rule cannot eliminate
    unclarity caused by ambiguous grammar or other linguistic aspects.
CFJ 3822 (called 19 Mar 2020): In the absence of a reason to think that
    things have changed, they can be presumed to have remained the same.
