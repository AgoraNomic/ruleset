Rule 2656/12 (Power=1.5)
Radiance

      The Illuminator is an office, responsible for tracking radiance.
      
      A player's Radiance is an integer player switch defaulting to 0,
      tracked by the Illuminator. When a player is "granted" or "gains"
      a specified amount of radiance, eir radiance is increased by that
      amount.
      
      Upon a correct announcement from a player that eir radiance is 100
      or more (correctly specifying the amount), e Outshines the Sun.
      
      When a player Outshines the Sun, e wins the game. When a player
      wins the game this way, the following happen in order:
      
      * Eir radiance is set to 0.
      
      * The radiance of each other player is set to half its current
        value (rounded down).
      
      Once per quarter, the Illuminator CAN by announcement (and SHALL
      during its first Eastman week) issue a Notice of Diminution, upon
      which all radiance switches are set to half their current value
      rounded down.
      
      Any player CAN increase eir radiance by 1 by paying a fee of 2
      Spendies.
