Rule 2656/10 (Power=1.5)
Radiance

      The Illuminator is an office, responsible for tracking radiance.
      
      A player's Radiance is an integer player switch defaulting to 0,
      tracked by the Illuminator. When a player is "granted" or "gains"
      a specified amount of radiance, eir radiance is increased by that
      amount.
      
      Upon a correct announcement from a player that eir radiance is 100
      or more (correctly specifying the amount), e wins the game. Then,
      eir radiance is set to 0, and all other players' radiance are set
      to half their current value rounded down.
      
      Once a quarter, the Illuminator CAN (and SHALL during its first
      Eastman week) publish a Notice of Diminution, upon which all
      radiance switches are set to half their current value rounded
      down.
      
      Any player CAN increase eir radiance by 1 by paying a fee of 2
      Spendies.
