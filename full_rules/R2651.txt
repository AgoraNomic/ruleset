Rule 2651/1 (Power=2)
The Election Cycle

      A holder of an elected office who did not become its holder by
      winning an election, and has not won an election for that office
      since, is an interim holder. An elected office that is either
      vacant or has an interim holder is an interim office.
      
      An office is term-limited if the most recent election for that
      office was resolved more than the length of that office's term
      prior. The term for the office of Prime Minister is 90 days. The
      term for all other elected offices is 180 days.
      
      A player CAN initiate an election for a specified elected office:
      
      a) With 2 support (if the office is either interim or term-
      limited) or 4 support (otherwise), and provided that the initiator
      becomes a candidate in the same message.
      
      b) By announcement, if e is the ADoP (or, if the office is the
      ADoP, if e is the Assessor) and the office is interim, or if e is
      the holder of that office.
      
      Once per quarter, the ADoP CAN and SHALL publish a Notice of
      Election specifying between 2-4 term-limited offices (if there
      fewer than 2 term-limited offices, the ADoP MUST instead list all
      of them).  Such a notice initiates elections for the specified
      offices.  The ADoP SHOULD prioritize offices that have gone
      longest since their last elections.
      
      The above notwithstanding, an election for an office CANNOT be
      initiated if one is already in progress.
