Rule 417/10 (Power=1)
The Archivist

      The Archivist is an office; its holder is responsible for ensuring
      the continued availability of documents of historical interest.
      
      The archivistâ€™s monthly report contains:
        * Instructions for accessing collections of:
          * Texts of each historic rule revision.
          * Texts of each proposal.
          * Judicial cases.
          * Public messages.
          * Messages to discussion fora.
          * Theses for which a person was awarded a degree.
          * Optionally, any other documents the Archivist deems worthy
            of archival.
        * A description of the completeness of each of the above
          collections.
      The referenced collections NEED NOT be perfectly complete or
      accurate, but the Archivist SHOULD work towards improving their
      completeness and accuracy.
