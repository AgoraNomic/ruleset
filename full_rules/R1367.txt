Rule 1367/26 (Power=2)
Degrees

      Certain patent titles are known as degrees. The degrees are
      
      - Associate of Nomic Art             (A.N.A.)
      - Associate of Nomic                 (A.N.)
      - Juris Doctorate of Nomic           (J.N.)
      - Baccalaureate of Nomic Art         (B.N.A.)
      - Baccalaureate of Nomic             (B.N.)
      - Magisteriate of Nomic Art          (M.N.A.)
      - Magisteriate of Nomic              (M.N.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic Art             (D.N.Art.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic History         (D.N.Hist.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic Law             (D.N.Law.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic Science         (D.N.Sci.)
      - Doctorate of Nomic Philosophy      (D.N.Phil.)
      
      There are four classes of degrees, ranked in ascending order of
      merit: Associate degrees (A.N.A. and A.N.), Baccalaureate degrees
      (J.N through B.N.), Magisteriate degrees (M.N.A and M.N), and
      Doctorate degrees (D.N.Art. through D.N.Phil.).
      
      A specified degree CAN be awarded by any player other than the
      awardee, with 2 Agoran consent. It SHOULD only be awarded for the
      publication of an original thesis of scholarly worth (including
      responses to peer-review), published with explicit intent to
      qualify for a degree. The Herald SHOULD coordinate the peer-review
      process and the awarding of degrees.
      
      Degrees SHOULD be awarded according to the extent to which the
      thesis contributes to Nomic culture or thought: Associate degrees
      for an appreciable contribution, Baccalaureate degrees for a
      substantial contribution, Magisteriate degrees for a remarkable
      contribution, and Doctorate degrees for an exceptional
      contribution. Any degree at the Doctorate level SHOULD take into
      account the awardee's academic history and participation in Agora
      over time.
      
      Theses for Art degrees SHOULD demonstrate substantial creativity
      and need not be in written form. Theses for all other degrees
      SHOULD demonstrate substantial research or analysis. J.N.  and
      D.N.Law are appropriate for high-quality legal analysis, of the
      sort typical to CFJs, but exceeding an ordinary CFJ in depth.  The
      D.N.Hist. degree is appropriate for historical research,
      especially when it presents a narrative that educates Agorans
      about the events of the past. The D.N.Sci. degree is appropriate
      for theses that demonstrate concrete or scientific thinking,
      whereas the D.N.Phil. is appropriate for theses that demonstrate
      abstract or philosophical thinking.
