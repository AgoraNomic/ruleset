Rule 2350/19 (Power=3)
Proposals

      A proposal is a type of entity consisting of a body of text and
      other attributes. A player CAN create (syn. submit) a proposal by
      announcement, specifying its text and optionally specifying any of
      the following attributes:
      
      * An associated title.
      
      * A list of coauthors (which must be persons other than the
        author).
      
      * An adoption index.
      
      Creating a proposal adds it to the Proposal Pool. Once a proposal
      is created, its text, author, and AI cannot be changed. The author
      (syn. proposer) of a proposal is the person who created it.
      
      The author of a proposal in the Proposal Pool CAN remove (syn.
      retract, withdraw) it from the Pool by announcement.
      
      The destruction of a proposal and the causing of a proposal to
      cease being a proposal are secured. The removal of a proposal from
      the Proposal Pool, other than by distribution, is secured.

Annotations:
CFJ 1647 (called 30 Apr 2007): Preceding a proposal-like text with the
    heading "Proposal:" and a title can be sufficient to clearly
    indicate that it is intended to become a proposal, but is not if it
    can be interpreted as quoting an existing proposal.
CFJ 1717 (called 08 Aug 2007): Preceding a proposal-like text with the
    question "What is the title of this proposal?" can be sufficient to
    clearly indicate that it is intended to become a proposal.
CFJ 3744-3745 (called 23 Jun 2019): When creating a proposal by
    announcement, specifying an impossible value for an optional
    attribute makes the creation fail.
