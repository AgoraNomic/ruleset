Rule 2681/1 (Power=1)
Acting on Commitment

      A Fingerprint for a document (the Plaintext) is a document that
      could not have been reasonably created without knowledge of the
      Plaintext, and which is related to the Plaintext in such a way
      that one could not reasonably produce another document related to
      that Fingerprint in the same way.
      
      A person CAN make a commitment to a particular kind of document by
      publishing a statement that purports to be a Fingerprint for a
      document of that kind. If the statement is in fact such a
      Fingerprint, the person CAN then reveal the commitment by
      publishing the Plaintext corresponding to that Fingerprint and
      clearly indicating which Fingerprint the Plaintext relates to.
      
      A person making a commitment SHOULD specify the method used to
      produce the Fingerprint from the Plaintext.
