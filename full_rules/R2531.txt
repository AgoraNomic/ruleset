Rule 2531/18 (Power=2)
Defendant's Rights

      An infraction is automatically forgiven if:
      
      (1) the alleged infracter can't be established by a preponderance
          of the evidence to have committed the infraction;
      
      (2) at the time the alleged infraction occurred, it was not an
          infraction;
      
      (3) the infraction was for failure to take an action that the
          infracter, through no fault of eir own, COULD NOT have
          performed;
      
      (4) the infraction is for conduct that the infracter, through no
          fault of eir own, was obliged to undertake by a rule of equal
          or greater power to the one e violated;
      
      (5) the infracter could not have avoided the infraction when
          exercising the highest reasonably possible standard of care;
          or
      
      (6) any available non-null punishment would be blatantly and
          obviously unsuited to the conduct which constitutes the
          infraction or to the person who committed the infraction.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any attempt to investigate
      an infraction which would result in the creation of blots is
      INEFFECTIVE if:
      
      (1) it does not include the specific reason for the fine; or
      
      (2) it would result in a punishment that is blatantly and
          obviously unsuited to the conduct which constitutes the
          infraction or to the person who committed the infraction.

Annotations:
CFJ 2531 (called 11 Apr 2020): A fine is "blatantly and obviously
    unsuited to the conduct which constitutes the reason for its levy"
    if it clearly contravenes the sentencing guidelines contained in the
    rules.
