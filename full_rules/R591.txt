Rule 591/51 (Power=1.7)
Delivering Judgements

      When a CFJ is open and assigned to a judge, that judge CAN assign
      a valid judgement to it by announcement, and SHALL do so in an
      officially timely fashion after this becomes possible.
      
      The valid judgements for an inquiry case are as follows, based on
      the facts and legal situation at the time the inquiry case was
      initiated, not taking into account any events since that time:
      
      * FALSE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
        logically false.
      
      * TRUE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
        logically true.
      
      * IRRELEVANT, appropriate if the veracity of the statement is
        not relevant to the game or is an overly hypothetical
        extrapolation of the game or its rules to conditions that don't
        actually exist, or if it can be trivially determined from the
        outcome of another (possibly still undecided) judicial case that
        was not itself judged IRRELEVANT.
      
      * INSUFFICIENT, appropriate if the statement does not come
        with supporting arguments or evidence, and the judge feels as if
        an undue burden is being placed on em by the lack of arguments
        and evidence. A CFJ judged as INSUFFICIENT SHOULD be submitted
        again with sufficient arguments/evidence.
      
      * DISMISS, appropriate if the statement is malformed, undecidable,
        if insufficient information exists to make a judgement with
        reasonable effort, or the statement is otherwise not able to be
        answered with another valid judgement. DISMISS is not
        appropriate if PARADOXICAL is appropriate.
      
      * PARADOXICAL, appropriate if the statement is logically
        undecidable as a result of a paradox or or other irresolvable
        logical situation. PARADOXICAL is not appropriate if IRRELEVANT
        is appropriate, nor is it appropriate if the undecidability
        arises from the case itself or in reference to it.
      
      If the judge of an open CFJ has not violated a time limit for
      assigning it a judgement, and has not previously filed a motion to
      either extend or reconsider the case, e CAN file a motion to
      extend the case by announcement. Doing so extends eir judgement
      deadline for that case by one week. In doing so, e SHOULD include
      a (nonbinding) draft or outline of eir current thoughts on the
      case.

Annotations:
CFJ 1835 (called 18 Dec 2007): A question cannot generally take the
    place of a statement in initiating an inquiry case.
CFJ 1903 (called 06 Feb 2008): The question-statement equivalence
    established by this rule applies only for the purposes of the
    subject of an inquiry case, not for acting by announcement.
CFJ 1671 (called 17 May 2007): The truth or falsity of a statement can
    be determined as of the initiation of a CFJ even if public knowledge
    at the time of initiation was not sufficient to determine it.
CFJ 1482 (called 10 Feb 2004): If the truth of a CFJ statement logically
    depends on the truth of statements of a previously-called CFJ which
    has not yet been judged, the judge is entitled to treat this as a
    situation of insufficient information being available.
CFJ 1744 (called 18 Sep 2007): It is not the job of the judge to hunt
    down or request the information that would be required to render a
    substantive judgement.
CFJ 1771 (called 28 Oct 2007): If an inquiry case revolves around the
    interpretation of a specific message, and the initiator does not
    provide a reasonable reference to that message , the judge is
    entitled to treat this as a situation of insufficient information
    being available.
CFJ 1732 (called 23 Aug 2007): If a particular player holds a particular
    office, and an inquiry case on a statement that that player holds
    that office is judged FALSE, that player still holds that office.
CFJ 2281 (called 19 Nov 2008): For the purposes of determining the
    validity of an inquiry case, the term "statement" should be
    interpreted loosely.
CFJ 3837 (called 24 May 2020): A statement formed from the logical
    combination of a proposition that has no bearing on the game and one
    that does is IRRELEVANT.
