Rule 2141/16 (Power=3.2)
Role and Attributes of Rules

      A rule is a type of instrument that is always taking effect and
      has the capacity to govern the game generally. A rule's content
      takes the form of a text, and is unlimited in scope. The ruleset
      is the set of all currently-existing rules.
      
      Every current rule has power between 0.1 and 4.0 inclusive.
      
      Every rule shall have an ID number, distinct among current and
      former rules, to be assigned once by the Rulekeepor by public
      designation.
      
      Every rule shall have a title to aid in identification. If a rule
      ever does not have a title, then the Rulekeepor CAN and SHALL
      assign a title to it by announcement in a timely fashion.
      
      For the purposes of rules governing modification of instruments,
      the text, power, ID number, and title of a rule are all
      substantive aspects of the rule. However, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the Rulekeepor CAN set rule aspects as described
      elsewhere in this rule.

Annotations:
CFJ 1498 (called 12 Apr 2004): A rule's title is not strictly a name for
    the rule, and so rule titles are not subject to the uniqueness
    requirement on names of rule-defined entities.
CFJ 2013 (called 17 Jun 2009): Rule 2141 does not imply that the power
    of rules is physically unlimited: they can only affect the world
    outside the game by prescribing or proscribing player behavior.
CFJ 2213 (called 07 Oct 2008): The powers granted to rules by the first
    paragraph of Rule 2141 are general, and only apply as otherwise
    stated by the Rules.
CFJ 2367 (called 05 Feb 2009): A rule need not "govern" anything in the
    game to be a rule, e.g. a rule consisting entirely of nonfunctional
    ASCII art is still a rule.
