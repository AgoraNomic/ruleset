History:

Enacted by P4329 'Remantling' (Goethe), 09 Jun 2002
Amended(1) by SLR ratification, 11 Mar 2019

Annotations:
CFJ 1881 (called 25 Jan 2008): This rule does not impose an obligation
    to always Dance a Powerful Dance, because "Marvy" is currently
    undefined.
CFJ 1736 (called 23 Aug 2007): Failing to hail Eris does not necessarily
    constitute a violation of this rule.
CFJ 3902 (called 19 Mar 2021): Ratifying an SLR increments the version
    number if it ratifies an error.
