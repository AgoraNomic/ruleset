Rule 2618/7 (Power=2.2)
Promises

      Promises are a class of assets, tracked by the Notary. Their
      essential attributes are their text and creator. A consenting
      player CAN, by announcement, grant a specified entity a promise,
      specifying its text and becoming its creator. A promise's owner is
      referred to as its bearer. Promises with the same text, creator,
      and bearer are fungible. Promises with the same text and creator
      SHOULD be referred to by the same title, but the title is not an
      essential attribute of the promise, just a way of referring to it.
      
      The creation of promises is secured. The text of a promise CANNOT
      be altered after it is created.
      
      A player (the casher) CAN, by announcement, cash a promise,
      provided that both a) any conditions for cashing it specified by
      its text are unambiguously met, and b) either the casher is the
      promise's bearer, or the promise is owned by the Library. By doing
      so, e acts on the creator of the promise's behalf, causing the
      creator to act as if e published the promise's text, and destroys
      the promise.  However, to limit recursion, no promise can be
      cashed during the execution of another promise unless it existed
      before the execution of that promise began. The bearer SHOULD
      recite the promise's essential attributes in the same message e
      cashes it.
      
      In a promise's text, "the bearer" and "the casher" (or the like)
      both refer to the player who cashed the promise, and "this
      promise" (or the like) refers to the promise. The text of the
      promise can refer to the context of the message in which it is
      cashed, but the context of the message does not otherwise change
      the meaning of the promise.
      
      The Library is an entity and CAN own promises.
      
      The creator of a promise CAN take or revoke it from the Library by
      announcement, unless the promise's text unambiguously designates
      it as irrevocable. Any player CAN revoke a specified promise from
      the Library without objection. If a promise specifies expiration
      conditions then any player CAN by announcement destroy it while
      the expiration conditions are unambiguously met.
