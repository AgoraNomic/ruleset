Rule 2493/11 (Power=3)
Regulations

      A regulation is a textual entity defined as such by a Rule (its
      parent rule) and existing solely because that Rule defines its
      existence. A regulation has no effect other than those that the
      Rules explicitly give it.
      
      A regulation CAN be enacted, amended, and repealed as specified by
      its parent rule. Regulations are tracked by the Rulekeepor as part
      of eir monthly report in a fashion similar to rules.
