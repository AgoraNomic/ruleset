Rule 478/43 (Power=3)
Fora

      Publicity is a secured forum switch with values Public,
      Discussion, and Foreign (default), tracked by the Registrar.
      
      The Registrar CAN change the publicity of a forum without
      objection as long as:
      
      1. e sends eir announcement of intent to that forum; and
      
      2. if the forum is to be made public, the announcement by which
         the Registrar makes that forum public is sent to all existing
         public fora.
      
      Each player should ensure e can receive messages via each public
      forum.
      
      A public message is a message sent via a public forum, or sent to
      all players and containing a clear designation of intent to be
      public. A rule can also designate that a part of one public
      message is considered a public message in its own right. To
      "publish" or "announce" something is to send a public message
      whose body contains that thing. To do something "publicly" is
      to do that thing within a public message.
      
      Where the rules define an action that a person CAN perform "by
      announcement", that person performs that action by, in a single
      public message, specifying the action and setting forth intent to
      perform that action by sending that message, doing both clearly
      and unambiguously.
      
      Any action performed by sending a message is performed at the time
      date-stamped on that message. Actions in messages (including
      sub-messages) are performed in the order they appear in the
      message, unless otherwise specified. Allowing regulated actions
      performed by sending a message to take place simultaneously must
      be done explicitly and is secured at power 2.

Annotations:
CFJ 1451-1452 (called 06 Mar 2003): A message that is split into
    multiple email messages can qualify as a single message for game
    purposes, if it is obvious how to combine the parts to reconstruct
    the single message.
CFJ 813 (called 22 Oct 1995): A Player need not prove that e can receive
    the PF.
CFJ 831 (called 10 Nov 1995): 'The Date: header of a message is not
    necessarily the time at which the message takes effect.'
CFJ 2205 (called 02 Oct 2008): A message takes effect at exactly one of
    the times date-stamped on it; selecting which one is a matter of
    game custom.
CFJ 2212 (called 07 Oct 2008): An IRC channel is a forum.
CFJ 2211 (called 07 Oct 2008): It is generally possible for an IRC
    channel to be a public forum.
CFJ 2214 (called 07 Oct 2008): Some IRC messages, such as NICK, are sent
    to all members of an IRC channel but are not sent via that channel.
CFJ 866 (called 08 Apr 1996): A message is "received" when the message
    enters the recipient's normal technical domain of control, whether
    this be eir private machine or eir private account on a shared
    machine (but not the shared machine itself, if the recipient does
    not control it).
CFJ 1112: In order to submit a Proposal, in the sense of R1865 and
    elsewhere, it is not sufficient that a collection of text 'with the
    clear indication that that text is intended to become a Proposal'
    (R1483) merely be sent to the Public Forum by a Proposing Entity;
    the collection of text must also be received in the Public Forum.
CFJ 1214-1215 (called 14 May 2000): Conditional actions (of the form "If
    X, I do Y") are effective only where the relevant agents (such as
    recordkeepors) are able to conclusively determine the value of the
    conditional from publicly-available information.
CFJ 1314 (called 15 Aug 2001): If a message sent to a public forum is
    rejected by the list moderator, it still qualifies as having been
    sent via a public forum.
CFJ 1905 (called 07 Feb 2008): Regardless of CFJ 1314, a message has not
    been sent via a forum until most persons who have arranged to
    receive messages via the forum receive it.
CFJ 1888 (called 31 Jan 2008): Sending a message to a Discussion Forum,
    or other mailing list except for a Public Forum, does not qualify as
    sending it to all players.
CFJ 1631 (called 29 Apr 2007): Public announcements must be made in the
    message body; the subject line is insignificant.
CFJ 1784 (called 05 Nov 2007): An undescriptive or misleading subject
    line does not deprive the message body of effect.
CFJ 1880 (called 22 Jan 2008): A phrase that would, in the message body,
    cancel the effect of the rest of the message, does not have such an
    effect if it appears in the subject line.
CFJ 1761 (called 30 Sep 2007): Publishing part of a message is a
    different action from publishing the whole message.
CFJ 1646 (called 30 Apr 2007): The act of "publishing" or "announcing"
    is accomplished when the message has left the sender's technical
    domain of control, indicated by one of the "Received:" headers0.
CFJ 1768 (called 22 Oct 2007): The right of participation in the fora is
    the right to participate in them for their intended purposes, and is
    not necessarily infringed by regulations regarding the manner and
    type of participation.
CFJ 1738 (called 29 Aug 2007): An obligation on a player to not publish
    statements that e believes are true would conflict with the right of
    participation in the fora.
CFJ 1719 (called 12 Aug 2007): A player can, if e intends, have public
    messages sent on eir behalf, including via a web form that allows
    all-comers to send messages on eir behalf without specific approval.
CFJ 1336 (called 13 Dec 2001): A public statement that one wishes to
    perform an action that one can perform by announcement can
    constitute an announcement that performs that action.
CFJ 1621 (called 08 Feb 2007): Where an action can be performed by
    announcement, announcing that one deems something to be the case
    that would result from that action does not constitute performing
    the action.
CFJ 1584 (called 24 Feb 2006), CFJ 1728 (called 20 Aug 2007): ' Saying
    "I do X 1000 times", where X is something that can be done by
    announcement, is an acceptable shorthand for 1000 instances of "I do
    X", but this shorthand cannot be used with an infinite repeat count,
    because it is impossible to write out an infinite number of
    instances of "I do X".'
CFJ 1774 (called 01 Nov 2007): Saying "I do X 10000 times", where X is
    something that can be done by announcement, does not necessarily
    achieve 10000 instances of X, if writing out 10000 instances of "I
    do X" would be a substantial effort such that using the shorthand is
    abusive. The presumption is in favour of the shorthand being
    successful.
CFJ 1775 (called 01 Nov 2007): If an announcement of the form "I do X N
    times" is not be acceptable shorthand for N instances of "I do X",
    then the announcement is completely nullified, and does not have the
    effect of M instances of "I do X" for any non-zero repeat count M.
CFJ 1730 (called 22 Aug 2007): An appropriate announcement will
    accomplish an action even if its author believed the action was
    impossible.
CFJ 1841 (called 20 Dec 2007): A message-based action cannot be
    retroactive.
CFJ 1971 (called 22 May 2008): An announcement with a general disclaimer
    as to its contents cannot fulfill a requirement to report
    information, but it may successfully cause game actions to be taken
    if the actions do not depend on the truth value of the disclaimed
    contents.
CFJ 2133 (called 09 Aug 2008): A disclaimed statement cannot cause an
    action to be taken by announcement.
CFJ 2112 (called 23 Jul 2008): An action is only taken by announcement
    if the Rules define it as such; e.g., posting an objection to a
    dependent action is not an action taken by announcement.
CFJ 2151 (called 05 Sep 2008): Some unregulated actions, such as
    celebrating and revealing things, can be taken by announcement.
CFJ 2086 (called 15 Jul 2008): Message-based actions are always taken in
    some order, never precisely simultaneously, possibly unless
    otherwise stated.
CFJ 2179 (called 23 Sep 2008): An message-based action can be taken even
    if its sender cannot be identified.
CFJ 2221 (called 13 Oct 2008): When an action is specified as "can do X
    in order to do Y", and a player does X without specifying intent to
    do Y, e does not do Y.
CFJ 2238 (called 22 Oct 2008): The requirement of unambiguous
    specification applies to the parameters of an action.
CFJ 2363 (called 01 Feb 2009): "X can do Y by doing Z" does not imply
    that X can do Z.
CFJ 2441 (called 06 Apr 2009): Due to a limitation of the mailing list
    archives, attaching a message with a particular text does not count
    as publishing that text.
CFJ 3106 (called 19 Oct 2011): When a person announces that "e performs"
    an action, the referent of "e" (i.e. eir identity) must be clear.
CFJ 3002 (called 19 Apr 2011): A message of the form "This statement
    causes {action}" is ineffective as a way to perform {action}, and
    may be an attempt to act on behalf of the statement.
CFJ 2899 (called 12 Nov 2010): A player's real name does not necessary
    identify em.
CFJ 3409 (called 09 Apr 2014): An action can be performed in the subject
    line of a message, if it sufficiently clear (as outlined in the
    judgment).
CFJ 3603-3604 (called 16 Nov 2017): ASCII art of text can be clear
    enough to suffice for communications, and in particular for taking
    actions by announcement.
CFJ 3630 (called 02 Mar 2018): An action referencing outside content
    requires that the attempt to act is clear, the nature of the
    attempted action is clear, and the outside context cannot be altered
    by em and will remain available long enough for others to interpret
    it.
CFJ 3642 (called 15 Jun 2018): Regardless of CFJ 1314, a message has not
    been sent via a public forum if its non-reception by some persons
    who arranged to receive it has affected which game actions they
    chose to take or not to take.
CFJ 3790 (called 01 Jan 2020): The sender of a message is the last
    exerciser of free will that exercised free will on its path.
CFJ 3884 (called 06 Sep 2020): A forum is an open medium for
    communication.
CFJ 3855 (called 22 Jun 2020): Emails from two or more persons never
    constitute one Agoran message.
CFJ 3948 (called 05 Mar 2022): Sending a message "to" a player via a
    nonpublic forum requires, at minimum, explicit signaling of the
    intended recipient in a forum-dependent manner.
CFJ 3663 (called 24 Sep 2018): Player-introduced (non-rules) jargon may
    count as "clear" communication, but must pass various tests of
    clarity and usage to be acceptable as a general shorthand.
CFJ 4001 (called 07 Nov 2022): For an announcement to be clear and
    unambiguous, any conditionals it contains must be determinate at the
    time it is made.  Conditionals that depend on future state do not
    meet this standard.
CFJ 3885 (called 04 Oct 2020): Message metadata (such as subject) is not
    considered to be part of a public message.
CFJ 4103 (called 10 Jan 2025): If a forum is a mailing list, the content
    of an email message sent via that forum is the content of the email
    sent out to the mailing list's subscribers, even if the mailing list
    software presents the message differently in other contexts, such as
    a web interface or archival format.
