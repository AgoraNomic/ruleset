Rule 2201/15 (Power=3)
Self-Ratification

      When a public document published less than 180 days ago is first
      continuously undoubted for two weeks after publication:
      
      - If the rules define it as self-ratifying, it is ratified.
      
      - If the rules define it as a self-ratifying attestation to a
        given statement, the statement is ratified, with the publication
        time being the instant at which the document was published.
      
        This clause is inapplicable if the statement to be ratified
        cannot be reasonably ascertained from the ruleset and the
        contents of the message.
      
      The definition of documents as self-ratifying and the definition
      of documents as self-ratifying attestations are secured at power
      3.
      
      Any person CAN by announcement issue a doubt (syn. claim of
      error), identifying a public document published less than 180 days
      ago and explaining the scope and nature of a perceived error in it
      (or in a statement it attests to).
      
      When this happens, the publisher of the original document SHALL
      (if e was required to publish that document) or SHOULD (otherwise)
      do one of the following in a timely fashion, in an announcement
      that clearly cites the claim of error:
      
         1. Deny the claim (causing it to cease to be a doubt).
      
         2. Publish a revision.
      
         3. Initiate an inquiry case regarding the truth of the claim
            (if the subject is actually a matter of law), or cite a
            relevant existing inquiry case.
      
      The issuance of a doubt on a documents, the denial of a claim of
      error, and the ceasing of a doubt on a document to be a doubt are
      secured at power 3.

Annotations:
CFJ 1690 (called 19 Jun 2007): A challenge to a self-ratifying document
    {at the time of CFJ 1690, the resolution of an Agoran decision} must
    explicitly identify the document, either individually or as part of
    a set, and explicitly contest the accuracy of some aspect of it.
CFJ 1790-1791 (called 11 Nov 2007): A challenge to any part of a
    self-ratifying document prevents ratification of all parts of it.
CFJ 3658 (called 27 Aug 2018): The scope of a claim of error is the
    self-ratifying section of the report that contains the error.
