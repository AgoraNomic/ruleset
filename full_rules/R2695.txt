Rule 2695/4 (Power=0.5)
The Veblen

      The Veblen is a unique indestructible fixed asset tracked by the
      Absurdor, with ownership entirely restricted to players and Agora.
      If the Veblen would otherwise be in abeyance, or if it is owned by
      the Lost and Found Department, it is immediately transferred to
      Agora.
      
      The Veblen cost is a secured singleton positive integer switch
      tracked by the Absurdor and with default value one.
      
      A player CAN pay a fee of X spendies, where X is an integer not
      less than the current Veblen cost, to set the Veblen cost to X+1.
      When e does so, if e does not own the Veblen, the Veblen is
      transferred to em.
      
      If the Veblen has not been transferred or devalued within the past
      month, then a player CAN devalue the Veblen by announcement, thus
      setting the Veblen cost to half its current value (rounded up).
      
      The owner of the Veblen SHOULD conspicuously show off eir
      ownership of it from time to time.
      
      If the Veblen does not exist and no one has Created Something E
      Cannot Destroy in the past week, any player CAN, by announcement,
      Create Something E Cannot Destroy. When e does so, e wins the
      game, and the Veblen is created in eir possession. A player who
      wins in this fashion SHOULD submit a proposal to prevent the
      destruction from arising again.
