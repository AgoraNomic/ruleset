Rule 2632/5 (Power=2.0)
Complexity

      Complexity is a secured office switch reflecting how complex it is
      to fulfill the duties of its office. Its possible values are all
      integers from 0 to 3 inclusive, where 1 is the default. It is
      tracked in the ADoP's weekly report. The ADoP CAN, with 2 Agoran
      consent, flip the complexity of an office to a specified possible
      value.
      
      For each office a player holds, eir voting strength is increased
      by the complexity of the office for referenda on ordinary
      proposals, up to a maximum increase of 3 by this method.
