Rule 2578/5 (Power=3)
Fungibility

      Any two assets within a "fungible" class of assets (syn.
      "currency") that have the same owner are considered equivalent for
      the purposes of specification, granting, and transferring. The
      number of such assets an entity owns is that entity's "balance" of
      that currency.
