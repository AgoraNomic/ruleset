Rule 2683/3 (Power=0.5)
The Boulder

      The Absurdor is a sortitioned office.
      
      The Boulder's Height is a singleton integer switch defaulting to
      0, tracked by the Absurdor.
      
      The Boulder's Slope is a singleton integer switch defaulting to 1,
      tracked by the Absurdor.
      
      Each player CAN, once a week, by announcement, push the boulder.
      When a player pushes the Boulder, its Height is increased by 1.
      At the beginning of each week, if the boulder was pushed in the
      previous week at least as many times as the Boulder's Slope, then
      the Boulder's Slope is increased by 1; otherwise, the Boulder's
      Height is set to 0, and the Boulder's Slope is set to 1. The
      Absurdor SHOULD list the largest Height and Slope of the Boulder
      ever reached in eir report.

Annotations:
CFJ 4095 (called 23 Sep 2024): The Height switch is not associated with
    any specific dimension or direction; merely pushing the Boulder
    increases its Height, regardless of how a player announces e does
    so.
