Rule 2125/15 (Power=3)
Regulated Actions

      An action is regulated if: (1) the Rules limit, allow, enable, or
      permit its performance; (2) the Rules describe the circumstances
      under which the action would succeed or fail; or (3) the action
      would, as part of its effect, modify information for which some
      player is required to be a recordkeepor.
      
      A Regulated Action CAN only be performed as described by the
      Rules, and only using the methods explicitly specified in the
      Rules for performing the given action. The Rules are not to be
      interpreted so as to proscribe unregulated actions.
      
      The above notwithstanding, sending a message (in general or with
      specific attributes) is never a regulated action; however, the
      rules may be interpreted so as to proscribe sending public
      messages (in general or with specific attributes).

Annotations:
CFJ 3737 (called 15 Jun 2019): Actions that the rules state a player
    SHALL NOT perform are considered to be regulated actions.
CFJ 3793 (called 16 Jan 2020): Rule 2125 is an interpretive principle
    applied to the rules as a whole and not to any individual rule. For
    a method to be explicitly specified, it must actually specify a way
    that the action can be realized; it is not enough that a rule claims
    there is a method. Circular reasoning cannot be used to permit an
    action or to provide a method.
CFJ 3869 (called 18 Jul 2020): Sending messages to fora is not
    regulated, only the potential actions contained therein.
CFJ 3797 (called 22 Jan 2020): Whether coming into existence is
    regulated depends on the thing that is coming into existence. Coming
    into existence is regulated for rules-defined entities and is not
    regulated for entities of which the rules decline to take notice;
    for entities that are not defined by the rules, but of which the
    rules take notice, such as persons, coming into existence is not
    regulated but the collateral consequences (e.g. assigning switch
    values) are.
