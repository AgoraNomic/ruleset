Rule 2579/5 (Power=3)
Fee-based Actions

      If the Rules associate payment of a set of assets (hereafter the
      fee for the action; syns: cost, price, charge) with performing an
      action, that method for performing that action is a fee-based
      method.
      
      If the fee is a non-integer quantity of a currency, the actual fee
      is the next highest integer amount of that asset.
      
      To use a fee-based method, an entity (the Actor) who is otherwise
      permitted to perform the action must announce that e is performing
      the action; such an announcement indicates intent to pay that fee
      for the sole purpose of using that method to perform that action,
      and e SHALL specify the correct set of assets for that fee, though
      simplified wording such as "I buy X" is sufficient if the fee paid
      is reasonably unambiguous.
      
      Upon such an announcement:
      
        - If the Rules specify a recipient for the fee, and the Actor
          CAN transfer that specified fee from emself to the recipient,
          then that fee is transferred from the Actor to the recipient
          and the action is performed simultaneously;
      
        - If the Rules do not specify a recipient, and the Actor CAN
          destroy the specified fee in eir possession, then that fee in
          eir possession is destroyed and the action is performed
          simultaneously.
      
        - Otherwise, no changes are made to asset holdings and the
          action is not performed.
