Rule 2579/6 (Power=3)
Fee-based Actions

      If the Rules associate payment of a set of assets (hereafter the
      fee for the action; syns: cost, price, charge) with performing an
      action, that method for performing that action is a fee-based
      method.
      
      If the fee is a non-integer quantity of a currency, the actual fee
      is the next highest integer amount of that asset.
      
      To use a fee-based method, an entity (the Actor) who is otherwise
      permitted to perform the action must announce that e is performing
      that action; such announcement must clearly and unambiguously set
      forth intent to pay a fee for the sole purpose of using that
      method to perform that action. Additionally, such announcement
      must either clearly and unambiguously specify the correct set of
      assets for that fee or use simplified wording (e.g. "I buy X")
      that makes the intended fee reasonably clear and unambiguous (in
      particular, without stating an incorrect fee).
      
      Upon such an announcement:
      
        - If the Rules specify a recipient for the relevant fee, and the
          Actor CAN transfer that fee from emself to the recipient, then
          that fee is transferred from the Actor to the recipient and
          the action is performed simultaneously;
      
        - If the Rules do not specify a recipient, and the Actor CAN
          destroy the relevant fee in eir possession, then that fee in
          eir possession is destroyed and the action is performed
          simultaneously.
      
        - Otherwise, no changes are made to asset holdings and the
          action is not performed.
