Rule 2160/27 (Power=3)
Deputisation

      A player acting as emself (the deputy) CAN perform an action
      ordinarily reserved for an office-holder as if e held the office
      if all of the following are true:
      
       1) The rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of
          holding that office, to perform the action. (This requirement
          is fulfilled by the deputy performing the action.)
      
       2) It would be POSSIBLE for the deputy to perform the action,
          other than by deputisation, if e held the office.
      
       3) The deputy, when performing the action, announces that e is
          doing so by deputisation or by temporary deputisation.
      
       4) The deputy has not held the office in the past 7 days.
      
      (If the office is vacant, then the remaining items in this list
      need not be true.)
      
       5) A time limit by which the rules require the action to be
          performed has expired.
      
       6) The office's holder has not changed in the past 7 days.
      
       7) Any of the following are true:
      
          a) The deputy announced between 2 and 14 days earlier that
             e intended to deputise for that office for the purposes of
             the particular action.
      
          b) The time limit expired between 14 and 28 days ago.
      
          c) The time limit expired more than 28 days ago, and the
             deputisation is temporary.
      
      When a player deputises for a voluntary office, e becomes the
      holder of that office, unless the deputisation is temporary, doing
      so would make em Overpowered, and/or the action being performed
      would already install someone into that office.

Annotations:
CFJ 1776 (called 01 Nov 2007): A requirement to perform an action, for
    the purposes of this rule, can be a logical implication from rules
    and circumstances, not just directly imposed by the rules. In
    particular, it is possible to deputise to rotate the bench.
CFJ 2400 (called 06 Mar 2009): Deputisation is generally treated as if
    the deputy gained the office immediately before the action, and lost
    it immediately after.
CFJ 3739 (called 16 Jun 2019): To perform an action by temporary
    deputisation is to deputise.
