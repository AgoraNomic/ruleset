Rule 2140/5 (Power=3)
Power Controls Mutability

      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no entity with power below
      the power of this rule can
      
      1. cause an entity to have power greater than its own.
      
      2. adjust the power of an instrument with power greater than its
      own.
      
      3. set or modify any other substantive aspect of an instrument
      with power greater than its own (that is, one that affects the
      instrument's operation).

Annotations:
CFJ 2981 (called 21 Mar 2011): An attribute of an instrument is not
    "modified" when an initial value is set for it.
CFJ 2945 (called 22 Dec 2010): An attribute of an entity is "changed"
    when it is removed/unset.
CFJ 2855 (called 08 Sep 2010): Absent security or similar explicit
    prohibitions, a low-power proposal generally CAN change game
    quantities defined in higher-power rules without interfering with
    the "substantive aspects" of the higher-powered rules.
