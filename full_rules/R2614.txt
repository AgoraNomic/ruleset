Rule 2614/11 (Power=3.1)
Eclipse Light

      An emergency message is one whose subject line contains the text
      "[Emergency]".
      
      The Prime Minister CAN, in an emergency message and with 3 Agoran
      consent, enact, amend, or repeal Emergency Regulations, provided
      that the intent to do so was also contained in an emergency
      message. To the extent explicitly permitted by this rule,
      Emergency regulations are always taking effect.
      
      Emergency Regulations CAN, as part of their effect:
        - Extend any deadline provided for by any instrument other than
          this rule, including a deadline for an obligation to be met,
          or deadline prior to which an action must be performed in
          order to be valid, such as the end of voting period. Such an
          extension CANNOT cause the total time period, such as the
          time from when an obligation was created to the deadline or
          the whole of a voting period, to be more than double its
          original length.
        - Create, destroy, or transfer assets, or require or forbid
          their creation, destruction, or transfer.
        - Collectively, exercise Mint Authority
        - Cause one or more players to win Agora.
        - Appoint or remove officeholders, other than Prime Minister or
          Speaker.
        - Modify the Festivity.
        - Award Patent Titles that are either Badges or are not
          mentioned in any Rule.
        - Modify the Publicity of Fora.
      
      The Prime Minister CAN, in an emergency message and with 4 Agoran
      Consent, provided that the intent to do so was also contained in
      an emergency message, Extend the Emergency.
      
      If there is an Emergency Regulation that has existed for at least
      a month and the Prime Minister has not Extended the Emergency in
      the past month, any player CAN, with 7 days notice, repeal all
      Emergency Regulations.
      
      If the Prime Minister has not sent a message to a public forum in
      the preceding four days, the Speaker CAN exercise eir powers under
      this rule as if e were the Prime Minister, and notwithstanding any
      rule that would prohibit a single player from holding both
      offices.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, Emergency Regulations
      CANNOT be enacted, amended, or repealed except as described in
      this Rule, nor can an entity that is not an Emergency Regulation
      be made to become an Emergency Regulation except as described in
