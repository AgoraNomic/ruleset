      The Prime Minister CAN, in an emergency message and with 3 Agoran

          or deadline prior to which an action must be performed in
          order to be valid, such as the end of voting period. Such an
          extension CANNOT cause the total time period, such as the
          time from when an obligation was created to the deadline or
          the whole of a voting period, to be more than double its
          original length.
        - Create, destroy, or transfer assets, or require or forbid
