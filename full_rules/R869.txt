Rule 869/55 (Power=3)
How to Join and Leave Agora

      Any entity (including a group of entities confederated with the
      intent of forming a single person under this Rule) that is or ever
      was able to willingly communicate original ideas is a person.
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no other entities are
      persons.
      
      Questions about personhood are to be resolved equitably, with
      regard for the good-faith of those involved and the customs of
      honorable play.
      
      Citizenship is a secured person switch with values Unregistered
      (default) and Registered, tracked by the Registrar. A registered
      person is a Player. To "register" someone is to flip that person's
      Citizenship switch from Unregistered to Registered.
      
      An Unregistered person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or
      prevented by Rules of power 3 or greater) register by publishing a
      message that indicates reasonably clearly and reasonably
      unambiguously eir desire to be a player at that time (for example,
      by saying "I register"). Rules to the contrary notwithstanding,
      two or more persons CANNOT become Registered simultaneously.
      
      The basis of a person is the set of all persons that are
      (recursively) part of em, in addition to emself. Rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding, a person CANNOT become Registered if eir
      basis overlaps with that of any current player.
      
      A player, acting as emself, CAN deregister (cease being a player)
      by announcement. If e does so, e CANNOT register or be registered
      for 30 days.
      
      A person, by registering, agrees to abide by the Rules. The Rules
      CANNOT otherwise bind a person to abide by any agreement without
      that person's willful consent.
      
      The Rules CANNOT compel non-players to act without their express
      or reasonably implied consent. The rules CANNOT compel players to
      unduly harass non-players. A non-person CANNOT be a player, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.

Annotations:
CFJ 1275 (called 19 Feb 2001): An entity is a Player if the Rules cannot
    distinguish that entity from a Player.
CFJ 1263 (called 05 Feb 2001): Any message expressing a clear desire or
    intent to register as a Player counts as a request for registration,
    whether or not it is explicitly phrased in the manner stipulated by
    the rules.
CFJ 3558 (called 06 Sep 2017): Registering by publishing that you want
    to be a player is a different mechanism than registering "by
    announcement" and so gets around rules limitations on "registering
    by announcement".
CFJ 3625 (called 12 Feb 2018): The rules don't bind recently
    deregistered players to avoid re-registering, they merely declare
    such attempts ineffective. Also, agreeing to be bound by some of the
    rules doesn't count as agreeing to be bound by all of them.
CFJ 3455 (called 03 Aug 2016): Ratifying an unregistered person as a
    player fails without that person's willful consent.
