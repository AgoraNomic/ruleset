Rule 2701/1 (Power=1.0)
Stamp Scamp

      A rare stamp is a stamp that is the only one of its type that
      exists.
      
      Stamp scamp is a singleton switch tracked by the Collector with
      possible values of each player and null (default). Upon a correct
      announcement that a specified player owns more rare stamps than
      any other player, the stamp scamp switch is flipped to that
      player.
      
      If no person has done so by this mechanism in this quarter, the
      value of the stamp scamp switch, if a player, CAN by announcement
      cause another specified player to gain one stamp of that player's
      type.
