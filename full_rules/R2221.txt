Rule 2221/11 (Power=3)
Cleanliness and Tidy Filing

      Any player CAN clean a rule without objection by specifying one or
      more corrections to spelling, grammar, capitalization, formatting,
      and/or dialect, or to whether a synonym or abbreviation is used in
      place of a word or phrase, in the rule's text and/or title; when e
      does so, if any text changes were specified, that rule is amended
      by this rule by applying the changes as a single amendment
      (failing as a whole if any fail); then, if any title changes were
      specified, that rule is retitled by this rule by applying the
      changes as a single retitling (failing as a whole if any fail).
      
      Any player CAN refile a rule without objection, specifying a new
      title; the rule is retitled to the specified title by this rule.
      
      Cleaning rules is secured. Refiling rules is secured.

Annotations:
CFJ 3800-3803 (called 25 Jan 2020): For a cleaning to replace a word
    with another word as a synonym, the two words must have exactly the
    same meaning.
CFJ 3900 (called 23 Feb 2021): Changing an undefined term to a defined
    term is not a rule change allowed via cleaning, even if the
    undefined term is due to a typo/error.
