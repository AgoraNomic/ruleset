Rule 2202/10 (Power=3)
Ratification Without Objection

      A public document is part (possibly all) of a public message.
      
      A player CAN, without objection, ratify a specified public
      document.
      
      Ratification Without Objection CANNOT cause the repeal, amendment,
      enactment, or mutation of any Rule, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding.
      
      A player SHALL NOT knowingly use or announce intent to use
      Ratification Without Objection to ratify a (prior to ratification)
      document containing incorrect or Indeterminate information when a
      corrected document could be produced with reasonable effort,
      unless the general nature of the document's error and reason for
      ratifying it is clearly and plainly described in the announcement
      of intent. Such ratification or announcement of intent to ratify
      is the Class 8 Infraction of Endorsing Forgery.

Annotations:
CFJ 1836 (called 18 Dec 2007): Ratification of an official document
    affects only those aspects of gamestate that are defined to be part
    of the official report, and not aspects that are incidentally
    reported on; in particular, ratification of an official report on
    certain parameters pertaining to each player does not ratify the
    list of players.
CFJ 2289 (called 25 Nov 2008): Ratification Without Objection of a value
    inseparable from another value may change the latter value even if
    it is not directly part of the report being ratified.
