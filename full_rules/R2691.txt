Rule 2691/4 (Power=2.0)
Sortition Procedure

      A player CAN by announcement initiate a sortition for a vacant
      sortitioned office for which a sortition is not ongoing. At the
      beginning of each quarter, for each sortitioned office for which a
      sortition is not ongoing, the ADoP CAN once by announcement, and
      SHALL in a timely fashion, initiate a sortition.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a sortition CANNOT be
      initiated for an office for which a sortition is ongoing.
      
      When a sortition is initiated, it enters the lots period. Any
      player CAN by announcement become an option for that office during
      this period. If a person ceases to be a player during this period,
      e also ceases to be an option for each current sortition.
      
      Seven days after a sortition is initiated, its lots period ends,
      after which:
      
        * If it has two or more valid options, then the ADoP CAN by
          announcement, and SHALL in a timely fashion after its lots
          period ends, randomly select one of those options.
      
        * If it has exactly one valid option, then any player CAN by
          announcement select that option.
      
        * If it has no valid options, then any player CAN by
          announcement declare the sortition ended with no selection.
      
      When a player is selected in a sortition as described above, e is
      installed into the associated office and the sortition ends.
      
      If a sortition is ever ongoing for a non-sortitioned office (or
      for an office that no longer exists), that sortition immediately
      ends.
