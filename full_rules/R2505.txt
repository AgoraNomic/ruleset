Rule 2505/1 (Power=1)
Random Choices

      When a Rule specifies that a random choice be made, then the
      choice shall be made using whatever probability distribution among
      the possible outcomes the Rule specifies, defaulting to a uniform
      probability distribution.
      
      The choice can be made using any physical or computational process
      whose probability distribution among the possible outcomes is
      reasonably close to that required by the Rules, and for which the
      final choice is not trivially predictable by the selecting person
      in advance. The selecting person SHOULD make the selection method
      public, and SHOULD use a method for which the final probability
      distribution can be readily confirmed.

Annotations:
CFJ 3925 (called 31 Aug 2021): If a random choice is required within a
    given week, it can't be chosen before that week begins.
CFJ 4007 (called 13 Feb 2023): The "final probability distribution" of a
    random selection is the result of a multistep process that is only
    considered "final" when the selection is used for the associated
    action.
