Rule 1742/23 (Power=2.5)
Contracts

      Any group of one or more consenting persons (the parties) may
      publicly make an agreement among themselves with the intention
      that it be binding upon them and be governed by the rules. Such
      an agreement is known as a contract. A contract may be modified,
      including by changing the set of parties, with the consent of all
      existing parties. A contract may also be terminated with the
      consent of all parties. A contract automatically terminates if the
      number of parties to it falls below one. It is IMPOSSIBLE for a
      person to become a party to a contract without eir consent.
      
      Parties to a contract governed by the rules SHALL act in
      accordance with that contract. This obligation is not impaired
      by contradiction between the contract and any other contract, or
      between the contract and the rules.
      
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any change that would cause
      the full provisions or parties of a contract to become publicly
      unavailable is canceled and does not take effect.
      
      The portion of a contract's provisions that can be interpreted
      with reference only to information that is either publicly or
      generally available are known as its body; the remainder of the
      provisions are known as the annex.
      
      A party to a contract CAN perform any of the following actions as
      explicitly and unambiguously permitted by the contract's body:
      
      * Act on behalf of another party to the contract.
      
      * By announcement, revoke destructible assets from the contract.
      
      * By announcement, transfer liquid assets from the contract to a
        specified recipient.
      
      Any player CAN cause a contract to be terminated (syn. "shred")
      without 2 objections. This SHOULD only be done to remove unused
      contracts or contracts deemed detrimental to the game as a whole.

Annotations:
CFJ 3644 (called 29 Sep 2018): If a set of players consent to make an
    agreement that is to be binding, it is a contract, regardless of
    whether or not it is explicitly stated to be one.
CFJ 3813 (called 13 Feb 2020): Agora is not a contract.
CFJ 3866 (called 08 Jul 2020): A contract cannot automatically create
    another contract, because the new contract would not have been made
    in a public message.
