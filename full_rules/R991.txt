Rule 991/35 (Power=2)
Calls for Judgement

      Any person (the initiator) can initiate a Call for Judgement (CFJ,
      syn. Judicial Case), specifying a statement to be inquired into by
      announcement. A case so initiated is an inquiry case.
      
      When a person initiates a Call for Judgement, e CAN optionally bar
      one person from the case by announcement.
      
      At any time, each CFJ is either open (default), suspended, or
      assigned exactly one judgement that was validly assigned.
      
      The Arbitor is an office, responsible for the administration of
      justice in a manner that is fair for emself, if not for the rest
      of Agora.
      
      Judge is an untracked CFJ switch with possible values of any
      person or former person, or "unassigned" (default). To "assign" a
      CFJ to a person is to flip that CFJ's judge to that person.  To
      "remove" or "recuse" a person from a being the judge of a CFJ is
      to flip that CFJ's judge from that person to unassigned.
      
      When an open CFJ's judge is unassigned, the Arbitor CAN assign any
      eligible player to be its judge by announcement, and SHALL do so
      in a timely fashion after it becomes an open and unassigned CFJ.
      The players eligible to be assigned as judge are all active
      players except the initiator and the person barred (if any). The
      Arbitor SHALL assign judges over time such that all interested
      players have reasonably equal opportunities to judge.  If a CFJ
      has no judge assigned, then any player eligible to judge that CFJ
      CAN assign it to emself without 3 objections.
      
      The Arbitor's weekly report includes a summary of recent judicial
      case activity, including open and recently-judged cases, recent
      judicial assignments, and a list of players interested in judging.
      
      If two CFJs become assigned to the same judge in the same message,
      those CFJs are "linked" to each other, unless that message
      specifies that the CFJs should not be linked. The Arbitor SHOULD
      consider linking two CFJs if they inquire about the same or
      substantially similar events and are called at approximately the
      same time.

Annotations:
CFJ 1692-1693 (called 20 Jun 2007): A CFJ can be unambiguously
    referenced by using the customarily-assigned sequence numbers, even
    if the number was not assigned in the public forum, provided that
    those involved accept it as unambiguous at the time.
CFJ 1355 (called 28 Apr 2002): Titles for CFJs are unregulated, so it is
    possible for a title to be assigned to a CFJ informally.
CFJ 3623 (called 09 Feb 2018): CFJing on a future hypothetical without
    specifying relevant assumptions is indeterminate.
CFJ 3805 (called 31 Jan 2020): Maintaining CFJ archives is hard.
CFJ 3876 (called 30 Jul 2020): Interest in judging is not regulated, and
    can be determined in accordance with common sense.
CFJ 3488 (called 16 May 2017): A non-player can be a judge and deliver
    judgements, and may in some circumstances be REQUIRED to do so.
CFJ 3822 (called 19 Mar 2020): Judges of ancient cases are still judges,
    unless they were explicitly recused.
