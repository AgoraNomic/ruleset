Rule 2709/3 (Power=1.0)
The Growth Cycle

      A player CAN plant an in-season Crop by paying a fee in Pyrite
      equal to its Seed Cost, provided that eir number of Hectares is
      greater than the number of Crops e planted earlier in the current
      Crop Season and has not yet harvested.
      
      Once per Crop that a player planted earlier in the current Crop
      Season and at least <Growth Duration> days ago, e CAN harvest it
      by announcement, gaining Pyrite equal to its Sell Price
      (exception: if the Weather for the week e planted it had already
      been selected at the time e planted it, e CANNOT harvest it before
      the end of the week after the week e planted it).
      
      When the Fields Wither, all unharvested Crops are lost. For the
      avoidance of doubt, the previous paragraph notwithstanding, a
      player CANNOT harvest a Crop planted before the most recent time
      the Fields Withered.
      
      Once each week, the Land Managor SHALL randomly select and
      announce the Weather for that week, which is either Good
      (probability 30%), Neutral (probability 60%), or Bad (probability
      10%). At the end of each week in which Bad Weather was selected
      this way, all unharvested Crops are lost.
      
      At the end of each Crop Season, the Fields Wither.
