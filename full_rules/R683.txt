Rule 683/27 (Power=3)
Voting on Agoran Decisions

      An entity submits a ballot on an Agoran decision by publishing a
      notice satisfying the following conditions:
      
      1. The ballot is submitted during the voting period for the
         decision.
      
      2. The entity casting the ballot (the voter) was, at the
         initiation of the decision, a player.
      
      3. The ballot clearly identifies the matter to be decided.
      
      4. The ballot clearly identifies a valid vote, as determined by
         the voting method.
      
      5. The ballot clearly sets forth the voter's intent to place
         the identified vote.
      
      6. The voter has no other valid ballots on the same decision.
      
      A valid ballot is a ballot, correctly submitted, that has not been
      withdrawn. During the voting period of an Agoran decision, an
      entity CAN by announcement withdraw (syn. retract) a ballot that e
      submitted on that decision. To "change" one's vote is to retract
      eir previous ballot (if any), then submit a new one. Submitting
      and withdrawing ballots is secured.

Annotations:
CFJ 1609 (called 13 Jan 2007): To "clearly identif{y} the matter to be
    decided" does not necessarily require specifying it in detail.
CFJ 1852-1853 (called 23 Dec 2007): Claiming to submit more votes than
    ones voting limit on the decision does not constitute the making of
    a false statement.
CFJ 3647 (called 24 Jun 2018): To attempt to "vote in the same way as
    another player" is ambiguous, because it may refer to the other
    player's vote at the time of the message (an unconditional vote) or
    at the time of resolution (a conditional vote).
CFJ 3860 (called 02 Jul 2020): An intentionally hidden ballot is not
    clearly cast and is therefore invalid.
