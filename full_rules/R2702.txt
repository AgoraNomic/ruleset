Rule 2702/0 (Power=1.0)
Agoran Bingo

      The Collar is an elected office responsible for administering
      Agoran Bingo.
      
      Bingo state is a singleton switch tracked by the Collar with
      possible values paused (default) and unpaused.
      
      If the bingo state is paused, the Collar CAN flip it to unpaused
      by announcement, and e SHOULD do so unless there is reasonable
      uncertainty as to the current bingo state or the validity of a
      claimed bingo, or the Collar is actively drafting, discussing, or
      trying to enact or amend eir administrative regulations. When the
      bingo state is paused, all existing bingo board selections are
      null and void, a player CANNOT select a bingo board, and a player
      CANNOT call bingo.
      
      If the bingo state is unpaused, a player whose bingo board
      contains at least one winning pattern of conditions -- as defined
      in the Collar's regulations -- that are all satisfied CAN call
      bingo by announcement. (For clarity, the states of any conditions
      not in the winning pattern are irrelevant.) Eir announcement:
      
      1) MUST specify the claimed winning pattern and the conditions it
         contains;
      
      2) MUST reveal any information required by the Collar's
         adminstrative regulations for the method e used to select a
         bingo board; and
      
      3) SHOULD include evidence demonstrating that each of the
        conditions in the winning pattern is satisfied, other than any
        conditions where such satisfaction is already clearly obvious.
      
      When a player successfully calls bingo, e wins the game and the
      bingo state is flipped to paused.
      
      If no player has successfully called bingo in the previous 3
      months, the Collar can flip the bingo state to paused without 2
      objections.
