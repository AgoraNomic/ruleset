Rule 2124/32 (Power=3)
Performing Tabled Actions

      For a given tabled intent, a player CAN, unless otherwise
      forbidden by the rules or the document enabling the action, act on
      eir own behalf, by announcement, to:
      * Become a supporter ("support" it), unless e tabled or previously
        supported it;
      * Become an objector ("object to" it), unless e previously
        objected to it;
      
      A supporter/objector to an intent, acting as emself, CAN by
      announcement cease to be a supporter/objector ("withdraw"
      support/objection) of that intent.
      
      Limiting the ability to support or object to an intent is secured
      at the power of the rule enabling that action to be performed.
      
      An intent is ripe if was tabled within the past 14 days, the
      Speaker hasn't objected to it in the past 48 hours, and its
      conditions, if any, are each clearly and unambiguously met.
      
      An intent is mature if it was tabled at least 4 days ago and
      nobody withdrew objections from it in the past 24 hours.
      
      A rule purporting to allow a person to perform a tabled action
      allows em to do so by announcement, if, considering only intents
      for that action/method combination:
      * With N Support: e is a sponsor or supporter of a ripe intent with
        at least N supporters.
      * Without N Objections: e is a sponsor of a mature ripe intent with
        less than N objectors.
      * With N Agoran Consent: e is a sponsor or supporter of a mature
        ripe intent with supporters greater than N times its objectors
        (e SHOULD list supporters and objectors).
      * With T notice: e is the sponsor of a ripe intent created at
        least T ago.
