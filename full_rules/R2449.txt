Rule 2449/3 (Power=3)
Winning the Game

      When the Rules state that a person or persons win the game, those
      persons win the game; specifically they win the Round that ends
      with the indicated win. Agora itself does not end and the ruleset
      remains unchanged. The Herald is then authorized to award those
      persons the Patent Title of Champion once, by announcement.
