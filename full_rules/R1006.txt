Rule 1006/49 (Power=2)
Offices

      An Office is a position described as an Office by the Rules.
      Officeholder is an office switch tracked by the ADoP, with
      possible values of any person or "vacant" (default). Each instance
      of the Officeholder switch is secured at the power of the Rule
      defining the associated office (or the power of this Rule, if the
      defining Rule's power is higher). An officer is the holder of an
      office, who may be referred to by the name of that office. If the
      holder of an office is ever not a player, it becomes vacant.
      
      Imposed offices and sortitioned offices are offices described as
      such by the rules that define them. All other offices are elected.
      An office is voluntary if and only if it is elected or
      sortitioned. The selection method for a sortitioned office is a
      sortition for that office. The selection method for an elected
      office is an election for that office.
      
      A person CANNOT be made the holder of a voluntary office without
      eir consent. A person voluntarily entering emself into the
      selection method of that office always satisfies this requirement,
      regardless of whether it meets the normal definition of consent.
      
      The holder of a voluntary office CAN resign it by announcement,
      causing it to become vacant. Any player CAN cause a voluntary
      office to become vacant without 2 objections.
      
      The non-interim holder of an elected office CAN, with 3 support,
      resign the office while appointing another player to become the
      holder of the office, provided that other player is one of the
      supporters.
      
      Immediately after a proposal finishes taking effect, if one or
      more offices exist that did not exist prior to the proposal taking
      effect, each such office, if it is vacant, becomes held by the
      author of the proposal.

Annotations:
CFJ 1660 (called 13 May 2007): This rule does not define the meaning of
    the term "office", in the sense meant by Rule 754, but rather
    references the usual English definition of "office" and governs
    offices as thus defined.
CFJ 1702 (called 12 Jul 2007): A requirement to submit something to an
    officer is satisfied by publishing it, even if that office is vacant
    at the time.
