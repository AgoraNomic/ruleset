Rule 2700/1 (Power=1.5)
Candles

      Candles are a fixed currency tracked by the Illuminator.
      
      Contests are the only entities permitted to own candles, and any
      candles held by any other entity are immediately destroyed.
      
      A player CAN pay a fee of 1 spendie to grant 1 candle to a
      contest.
      
      As explicitly and unambiguously permitted by a contest's body, a
      party to that contest CAN bestow a prize by an announcement
      clearly identifying the recipient player, the amount of radiance
      to award (N), and the relevant contest. Upon doing so, if the
      specified contest possesses at least N candles the following
      happen in order: N of its candles are destroyed, then the
      specified player gains N radiance.
