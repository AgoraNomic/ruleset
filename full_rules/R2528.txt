Rule 2528/1 (Power=3)
Voting Methods

      Each Agoran decision has a voting method, which must be
      AI-majority, instant runoff, or first-past-the-post. The voting
      method is that specified by the authorizing authority, or
      first-past-the-post by default.
      
      Each Agoran decision has a set of valid options (the choices that
      the voters are being asked to select from) and valid votes (the
      ways in which the voters can express their opinion or lack
      thereof). For AI-majority decisions, the valid options are FOR and
      AGAINST; for other decisions, the valid options are defined by
      other rules.
      
      The valid votes on an Agoran decision are:
      
      1. PRESENT;
      
      2. The valid conditional votes, as defined by rules of power at
         least that of this rule; and
      
      3. For an instant runoff decision, the ordered lists of entities.
      
      4. For any other decision, the valid options.
