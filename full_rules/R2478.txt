Rule 2478/29 (Power=1.7)
Justice

      An Infraction is a violation of a rule. The person who committed
      an infraction is its infracter.
      
      The Investigator for an infraction is the Referee unless e is the
      infracter. Otherwise, it is the Arbitor.
      
      The Class of an infraction is 2 unless a rule specifies a
      different Class for it.
      
      The Base of an infraction is N, where N is the number of
      previously-investigated, unforgiven infractions that have been
      committed by the same person in the past 30 days. The previous
      notwithstanding, if the base of an infraction would be greater
      than its class, the infraction's base is equal to its class.
      
      Within 14 days of an infraction being committed, or if the
      infraction has been noted in the past 60 days, the Investigator
      CAN investigate the infraction by announcement, specifying a
      number of blots between the Base and the Class of the infraction,
      inclusive. When e does so, that many blots are created in the
      possession of the infracter.
      
      The previous notwithstanding, an Investigator CANNOT investigate
      an infraction that has already been investigated or forgiven. The
      Investigator of a noted, unforgiven infraction SHALL investigate
      the infraction in a timely fashion after it has been noted;
      failure to do so is the Class N infraction of Favoritism, where N
      is equal to the Class of the noted infraction.
      
      A player CAN, by announcement, "note" an unforgiven infraction
      committed by any other player in the past 14 days, specifying the
      incident and the rule it violates (or name of the Infraction if
      it has one); but a player CANNOT note an infraction that has
      already been investigated.
      
      The Referee's weekly report contains a list of noted and
      investigated Infractions committed in the previous week.
