Rule 2713/1 (Power=1.0)
Scoring Numbers

      Whenever an inquiry case with an ID number is assigned a
      judgement, if it had never previously been assigned a judgement,
      its judge scores its ID number, unless its initiator had initiated
      4 or more other CFJs earlier in the same week that it was
      initiated.
      
      Whenever a distributed proposal is adopted, its author scores its
      ID number, unless its author had submitted 8 or more proposals
      earlier in the same week that it was submitted.
      
      Whenever a player scores a number as described in this rule, the
      Numerator CAN once, and SHALL in a timely manner, grant that
      player (and, if the number was scored due to the adoption of a
      proposal, also a randomly chosen other player who voted FOR on a
      referendum to adopt that proposal) a number card for each digit in
      that number, whose type is that digit.
      
      Officers SHALL NOT assign ID numbers to distributed proposals or
      CFJs that are out of sequence, but are given reasonable discretion
      to determine what "in sequence" means (e.g. officers may choose
      whether to include or exclude in the numbering sequence entities
      whose proposal or CFJ status is disputed or unclear). ID numbers
      that are more than 5 digits long cannot be scored (this is an
      exception to the other paragraphs of this rule and takes
      precedence over them).
