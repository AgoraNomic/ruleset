Rule 1030/13 (Power=3.3)
Precedence between Rules

      In a conflict between Rules, the conflict shall be resolved by
      performing the following comparisons in the sequence written in
      this rule, until the conflict is resolved.
      
      - In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
        the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
        Power; otherwise,
      
      - If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
        precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
        determining precedence relations, then the determinations of the
        precedence-determining Rule shall be used to resolve the
        conflicts; otherwise,
      
      - If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
        itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or takes
        precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
        provisions shall be used to resolve the conflict, unless they
        lead to contradictions between each other; otherwise,
      
      - If any of the rules in conflict have ID numbers, then the Rule
        with the lowest ID number takes precedence; otherwise,
      
      - The Rule enacted earliest takes precedence.
      
      Clauses in any other rule that broadly claim precedence (e.g. over
      "all rules" of a certain class) shall be, prima facie, considered
      to be limited claims of precedence or deference that are
      applicable only when such claims are evaluated as described within
      the above sequence.
      
      No change to the ruleset can occur that would cause a Rule to
      directly claim precedence over this Rule as a means of determining
      precedence. This applies to changes by the enactment or amendment
      of a Rule, or of any other form. This Rule takes precedence over
      any Rule that would permit such a change to the ruleset.

Annotations:
CFJ 1104 (called 20 Aug 1998): The presence in a Rule of deference
    clause, claiming that the Rule defers to another Rule, does not
    prevent a conflict with the other Rule arising, but shows only how
    the Rule says that conflict is to be resolved when it does arise.
CFJ 1114-1115 (called 27 Jan 1999): This Rule is to be applied to
    resolve Rule conflicts on a case-by-case basis; just because a Rule
    is inapplicable in one situation due to conflict with a Rule of
    higher precedence does not mean that the Rule is nullified in all
    cases.
CFJ 3796 (called 20 Jan 2020): If a situation can be arranged where a
    rule claims precedence over the rule defining precedence relations
    (currently R1030), the rules are inconsistent and the rule governing
    rule interpretation (currently R217) resolves the conflict.
