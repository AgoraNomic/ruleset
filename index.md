# The Agoran Rulesets

Welcome. If you are trying to access the ruleset of Agora Nomic, you've
come to the right place. This website is maintained by Jason, the
current Rulekeepor of Agora Nomic.

## Textual Rulesets

There are two flavors of Agoran Ruleset: The Short Logical Ruleset (SLR)
and the Full Logical Ruleset (FLR).

* [The Short Logical Ruleset](slr.txt) contains the full text of all
  currently enacted rules, organized into categories. If you are new to
  Agora, this is the most accessible version. A new version comes out
  every week, and these are date-stamped within the report.
* [The Full Logical Ruleset](flr-fresh.txt) contains the same rules as
  the SLR in the same order, along with a list of changes that rule has
  gone through as well as some other notable historical annotations.
  **Note that the file linked above is usually going to be unofficial
  and updated to include the most recent changes. Officially, the FLR is
  only published monthly. That version can be found [here](flr.txt).**
* [The Agora Nomic Code of Regulations](acorn.txt) contains the full
  text of all currently enacted regulations, organized into categories.
  A new version comes out every week.

## [Ruleset Format Updates](updates)

I make occasional changes to how the ruleset is formatted. This page
contains a list of each and every one.

## Other projects

Additionally, others have made software to track the ruleset. Here's a
list of links to those projects. **Warning: These all navigate
off-site.**

* [Gaelan's ruleset viewer](https://agora-ruleset.gaelan.me) displays
  the SLR in HTML format with a table of contents. This website is
  generated from current ruleset data like the textual rulesets linked
  above. This project is open-source. Its source code can be found
  [here](https://github.com/AgoraNomic/ruleset-viewer).
