    of Agora.
  rules:
  - 101  # The Game of Agora
  - 1698 # Agora Is A Nomic
- name: Important Temporary Rules
  note: |
    This category is a temporary dumping ground for rules that don't
    easily fit in any other category but that hold special relevance
    for the current gamestate.
  rules:
  - 2609 # Temporary CFJ Setup
- name: Players
  note: |
    This small section provides some rules detailing how joining and
    leaving Agora works. If you're a new player, this is probably the
    most important section to read.

  - 478  # Fora
  - 2139 # The Registrar
  - 1789 # Cantus Cygneus
- name: General Definitions
  note: |
    This section describes the terminology used by all the other rules.
