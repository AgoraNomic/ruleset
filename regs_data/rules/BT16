  Each turn represents six months of time. The first turn is called
  a Spring turn and the next a Fall turn. After each Fall turn, each
  Great Power must reconcile the number of units it controls with
  the number of supply centers it controls. At this time some units
  are removed and new ones are built, as specified in these
  regulations. After a Fall turn, if one Great Power controls 18 or
  more supply centers, all other Contestants cease to be
  Contestants.
