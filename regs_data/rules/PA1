text: |
  Players SHOULD format proposals in accordance with the following
  guidelines.  These guidelines represent the Promotor's preferred
  formatting. Most of these guidelines are flexible recommendations,
  but where something is marked as STRONGLY DISCOURAGED, doing it is
  actively inconvenient for the Promotor.

  I. Headers and Metadata.

  1. Format headers as close as possible to the heading used for
     distributions, which looks like this:

  Title: _____
  Adoption index: _._
  Author: ____
  Co-authors: ____, ____

  To be clear:
  a) write the fields in that order;
  b) write out all the fields, even the ones that have default
     values; and
  c) write each field on its own line.

  2. a) Give proposals titles 35 characters or less.
     b) Giving proposals titles over 70 characters is STRONGLY
        DISCOURAGED.  

  II. Bodies.

  1. Indent Proposals two spaces per indent level.

  2. a) Wrap proposal lines to 80 characters or less.
     b) Making it so the Promotor cannot wrap lines to 80 characters
        or less is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED unless it is absolutely
        unavoidable (e.g.  in the case of URLs).

  3. Players are STRONGLY DISCOURAGED from placing markings that
     indicate the start of the proposal's text on the same line as
     the start of the text.
