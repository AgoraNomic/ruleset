  A country controls a supply center when one of its units occupies
  that supply-center province after a Fall turn has been played and
  completed. Once a country gains control of a supply center, it can
  leave the center vacant and still keep control of it, as long as
  that center isnâ€™t occupied by another country at the close of a
  Fall turn. As part of eir Fall orders, each player adjusts the
  number of units it had to match the number of supply centers it
  controls. If a country has fewer supply centers than units, it
  must disband the excess number of units.  If a country has more
  supply centers than units, it can place new units in each
  unoccupied supply center of its home country that it still
  controls. All provinces can build armies, but only coastal
  provinces can build fleets.
