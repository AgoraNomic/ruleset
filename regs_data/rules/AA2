  It is RECOMMENDED to phrase CFJ statements so that they are
  possible to parse without outside context. For example, refer to a
  proposal or rule by ID number, or to a message by distinguishing
  features like its author and approximate timestamp, instead of
  writing "this proposal" or "that message". (An exception is
  self-references: "this CFJ", or "this message" meaning "the
  message in which this CFJ is called", is unambiguous and in fact
  traditional.)

  When calling a CFJ, players SHOULD ensure that the word "CFJ" is
  present in the subject line of the message, ideally near the
  beginning and ideally distinct from the rest of the line (e.g.
  "[CFJ]" or "CFJ:"). This helps ensure the CFJ is not missed.

  Gratuitous arguments to a CFJ need not be explicitly marked, or
  even submitted to a public forum (though they may be, for
  disambiguation). Anything seen by the Arbitor, through any forum,
  that looks like an argument will be accepted and recorded.
  (Arguments may even be submitted privately, which might be useful
  if, for example, anonymity is requested.)

  For other actions related to the office of Arbitor, such as
  judgements themselves, recusals, retractions, Motions and Moots,
  it is RECOMMENDED to draw the Arbitor's attention somehow if they
  are buried in replies to an unrelated thread. Otherwise, tags of
  the form "attn. Arbitor" or "@Arbitor" are unnecessary and indeed
  DISCOURAGED as they clutter subject lines.
