  There are four possible orders: Hold, Move, Support, and Convoy.
  Not giving a unit an order is interpreted as ordering it to hold.
  A Hold order orders a unit to stay where it is. A Move order
  orders a unit to move to a different province. Armies can only
  move onto adjacent inland or coastal provinces. Fleets can only
  move to adjacent water or coastal provinces. A Move order making
  use of a Convoy must specify what Convoy paths it will use or
  conditionals to determine such. Support orders help another unit's
  action, whether or not it is a unit of the same Great Power. An
  Army or Fleet can provide support to another Army or Fleet.
  Support can be offensive or defensive. A Convoy order orders a
  fleet in a water province to move an army from an adjacent coastal
  province to another adjacent coastal province.
