  Sealed-bid auctions function like generalized auctions except:

  * Players can only submit bids on a sealed-bid auction if they do
    not have a bid in that auction.
  * Bids must be initially hidden so that it is impossible to tell
    its value but that it is verifiable that the amount bid was *
    decided before the bid was placed. Anything that claims to be a
    bid and fits these conditions is considered a bid.
  * Sealed-bid auctions do not end when bidding is closed. Instead,
    they end four days afterward.
  * Each player SHOULD reveal eir bid amount on a sealed-bid auction
    while the auction is closed but has not ended. If e does not do
    so then eir bid is nulled.
  * The termination message also includes whether or not each bid is
    null.
  * The Nth awardee of a sealed-bid auction is the non-withdrawn
    funded player whose bid is not nulled and is the Nth highest of
    all bids placed.
