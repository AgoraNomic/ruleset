  Sealed-bid auctions function like generalized auctions except:

  * Players can only submit bids on a sealed-bid auction if they do
    not have a bid in that auction.
  * Bids must be initially hidden so that it is impossible to tell
    its value but that it is verifiable that the amount bid was
    decided before the bid was placed. Anything that claims to be a
    bid and fits these conditions is considered a bid.
  * The retrieval period for a sealed-bid auction lasts for seven
    days.
  * Each player SHALL reveal eir bid amount on a sealed-bid auction
    while the auction is in its retrieval period. Failing to do so
    is the Class 2 Crime of Potential Faking.
  * The termination message need not indicate any bids for which the
    amount bid is not known.
  * The Nth awardee of a sealed-bid auction is the player whose bid
    is the Nth-highest active bid on that auction.
