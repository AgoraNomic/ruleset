  Description
  ===========

  This tournament is a self-contained game inspired by Acquire where
  players build communities on a board, invest in those communities,
  and gain rewards when communities they invested in are absorbed by
  other communities.

  Playing
  =======

  Any player CAN become a participant of this Tournament at any time
  during its play by announcement.

  Any participant CAN cease to be so by announcement. A participant
  of this tournament ceases to be so when e becomes inactive in
  Agora. When a person ceases to be a participant, all assets e owns
  defined by this Tournament are destroyed.

  The Game Master for this tournament is also known as the Surveyor.

  Gaining Tokens
  ==============

  A Token is an asset ownable by participants only. Tokens CANNOT be
  transferred or destroyed except as otherwise allowed by this
  Tournament.  Each Token has a corresponding Symbol which can be
  any English letter A-J or any integer 0-9. Tokens owned by the
  same player with the same Symbol are fungible.

  Each participant has a Left, Middle, and a Right Token
  Constructor. By default, Token Constructors are set to construct
  nothing.

  For each of eir Token Constructors, players CAN once a week do one
  of the following by announcement:
  - Begin Constructing a Token with a specified Symbol.
  - Grant emself the Token that the Token Constructor is already
    constructing (if not set to nothing).

  The playboard
  =============

  The playboard is a grid of size 10 x 10. The x coordinates of the
  playboard are identified by English letters A-J, and the Y
  coordinates of the playboard are identified by integers [0-9].

  Adjacency is defined by being at the same cordinate on one axis,
  and exactly one coordinate away on the other axis.

  An example visualization of the initial playboard is below:

  Placing Tiles and Founding Communities
  ======================================

  If a tile has not been placed on a location on the board, it is
  empty.

  Participants CAN place a tile on an empty location by paying one
  letter token and one number token that correspond to that
  location's coordinates.

  If a tile is placed that is not adjacent to any tiles belonging to
  any communities, the player that placed it founds a new community,
  e is granted 1 investment for that community, and e becomes its
  founder. E CAN and SHOULD name the community after any color that
  starts with a different first letter than any existing community
  by announcement. If a community has not been named, the Surveyor
  CAN and SHALL do so by announcement.

  A player who is the founder of an existing community CANNOT place
  a tile that would found a new community.

  If a tile is placed adjacent to one or more tiles belonging to a
  single community, that tile belongs to that community.

  If a tile is placed adjacent to two or more tiles belongining to
  different communities, a merger happens.

  When a merger happens, if a single community involved in the
  merger has more tiles than each other community, that community is
  the acquiring community. If there is a tie, the tied community
  that gained a tile least recently is the acquiring community. The
  other communities are the acquired communities. All tiles
  belonging to the acquired communities cease to belong to them and
  begin to belong to the acquiring community.  Each player gains X
  (rounded down) Accolades for each acquired community e had an
  investment in, where X is the total tiles that belonged to that
  community immediately before the merger divided by the total
  number of investments that exist for that community and times the
  number of investments for that community that player owns. The
  acquired communities and all investments in all acquired
  communities are destroyed.

  Investments
  ===========

  An Investment is an asset. Investments CANNOT be transferred or
  destroyed except as otherwise allowed by this tournament. Each
  Investment corresponds with a Community. The investment limit is
  the current number of communities.

  Once per week a participant with less investments than the
  investment limit CAN grant emself an investment in any specified
  community by announcement.

  Participants CANNOT gain an investment when they are at the
  investment limit.

  Trading
  =======

  A participant can make a Trade Offer by announcement, specifying a
  token e owns, a set of symbols e wants, and, optionally, a set of
  participants allowed to accept the offer (defaulting to all
  participants if not specified).

  If a participant ceases to have any tokens matching a Trade Offer
  e made, the trade offer is withdrawn. Any participant can withdraw
  any trade offer e has made at any time by announcement.

  If a participant is in the set of participants allowed by a
  non-withdrawn trade offer and has a token matching the wanted set,
  e CAN accept that offer by announcement and specifying the
  corresponding token. When e does so, the token specified in the
  Offer is transferred to em, and the token e specified is
  transferred to the participant that made the trade offer.

  Tracking
  ========

  The Surveyor SHALL once a week publish an updated playboard, a
  list of all participants and all eir assets defined by this
  tournament, and a list of all communities and their number of
  tiles. E SHOULD include a history of moves made by players as
  well.

  Ending and Winning
  ==================

  Accolades are a currency. Accolades CANNOT be transferred or
  destroyed except as otherwise allowed by this tournament.

  When more than half of the tiles belong to a single community, the
  tournament ends.

  If it has been 3 months since the tournament started, the
  tournament ends.

  Immediately before the tournament ends, the participant with the
  greatest number of accolades wins.

  Clean-Up
  ========

  If any asset defined by this tournament would ever belong to
  Agora, a deregistered person, a deactivated player, the L&FD, or
  be in abeyance, it is instead destroyed.
