  If a player leaves the game or otherwise fail to submit orders on
  a given Spring or Fall turn, the Gamemaster SHALL attempt to replace
  em with a new Contestant, but if this fails, it's assumed that eir
  government has collapsed. Eir units all hold in position, but
  don’t support each other. If they’re dislodged, they’re disbanded.
  No new units are raised for the country. If a country in civil
  disorder has to remove units, the units farthest from the country
  are removed first. If units are equally distant, then remove
  Fleets before Armies and then in alphabetical order by the
  provinces in which they’re located.
