  Selective-bit auctions function like generalized auctions except:

  * Bidding messages on a selective-bid auction must also specify a
    lot that is preferred.
  * The Nth awardee of a selective-bid auction is the highest bid
    from a funded, non-withdrawn player whose preferred bid is that
    lot.
