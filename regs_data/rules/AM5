  Selective-bit auctions function like generalized auctions except:

  * Bidding messages on a selective-bid auction must also specify a
    lot that is preferred.
  * One bid class exists for each lot of a given auction, with bids
    falling into the class for the specified lot.
  * The Nth awardee of a selective-bid auction is the player who
    placed the highest bid in the set of bids made by funded, non
    withdrawn players whose preferred bid is the Nth lot.
