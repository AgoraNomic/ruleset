  If two units of equal strength or which are equally supported are
  trying to occupy the same province, all remain where they began.
  If two or more equally supported units are ordered to the same
  province, none of them can move. If two units are each ordered to
  the province that the other occupies, neither can move. If a move
  is successful, the attacking unit moves into the province to which
  it was ordered. If the unit that was attacked had no orders of its
  own to move elsewhere, itâ€™s defeated and dislodged from the
  province. The dislodged unit must retreat or be disbanded.
