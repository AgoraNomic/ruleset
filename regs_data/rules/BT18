  Bulgaria, Spain, and St. Petersburg have separately identified
  coasts, between which fleets cannot move. If Fleets occupy
  adjacent water provinces, an Army can be convoyed through all
  these water provinces on one turn, landing in a coastal province
  adjacent to the final Fleet in the chain.
