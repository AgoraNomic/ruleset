  For the Promotor to cause a proposal to become pending with 2+N
  support, where N is equal to the number of times e has done so in
  the past 7 days, is for em to certify it.

  A proposal is certifiable if:
  1. it is reasonably narrowly tailored to fix one or more problems,
     including a) bugs, b) errors, c) ambiguities, and d)
     vulnerabilities*; or
  2. unusual or exigent circumstance render it in the public
     interest for it to become pending via this method.

  * Note: Any of these problems may arise from a single source or
    the interaction of multiple sources, which may be individually
    unproblematic. This provision is to be interpreted broadly and
    flexibly to effectuate its spirit.

  The Promotor SHOULD NOT certify a non-certifiable proposal.
  Players SHOULD support an intent to certify a proposal if and only
  if it is certifiable.

  The author of a proposal in the pool CAN, by announcement, request
  certification of the proposal, provided e does so in a message
  that has either "Promotor" or "Proposal" in the subject line; e
  SHOULD NOT do so unless e believes eir proposal is certifiable and
  is ENCOURAGED to explain why eir proposal is certifiable. Once
  certification is requested, the Promotor SHALL respond publicly
  before publishing the next report that contains the proposal,
  unless the proposal is withdrawn or pended in the interim.
  Petitioning the Promotor to certify a proposal is DEPRECATED.
