  The Arbitor SHALL NOT assign a case to any person with a clear
  conflict of interest in its outcome.

  While there are players interested in judging, the Arbitor SHALL
  NOT assign cases to any other person. A player is "interested in
  judging" whenever e has communicated to the Arbitor that e is or
  will be (syn. "stood up"), provided that, since e last became
  interested, e has not done any of the following:
  * Been recused from a case for lateness.
  * Communicated to the contrary (syn. "sat down").
  * Become inactive.
  * Become deregistered.
  * Been omitted from a list of interested judges published by the
    Arbitor, if the list has been continuously undoubted for one
    week after its publication.
  
  The above notwithstanding, the Arbitor MAY always assign a case to
  emself; to the Referee; or to any person who has communicated to
  em an interest in judging the case (syn. "favoured" the case).

  If, but for this provision, this regulation would make it ILLEGAL
  for the Arbitor to assign a particular case at all, all other
  provisions of this regulation are null and void with respect to
  that case.

  When a judgement is issued that has major implications for the
  interpretation of a rule, and it is highly unlikely that the rule
  will be changed to alter the interpretation or the case reopened
  in the near future, the Arbitor SHALL in an officially timely
  fashion write a brief description of the implication and
  communicate it to the Rulekeepor with a recommendation for
  inclusion in the Full Logical Ruleset. (This duty is immediately
  discharged if the office of Rulekeepor is vacant.)
