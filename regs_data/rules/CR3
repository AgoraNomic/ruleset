  A. Event conventions

  A "right now" event must be true at the time a player calls
  bingo. Otherwise, the event is satisfied if it was true at any
  point between the time the bingo state was most recently flipped
  to unpaused and the time of the attempt to call bingo.

  Many events are triggered by "another player" (or similar
  language). To satisfy that event, the basis of the person in
  question must have no overlap with yours.

  Events are to be interpreted based on the definitions in the
  rules. For example, "declare apathy" means the mechanism
  currently defined in rule 2465 and not just a statement made in a
  public forum. Repealing rule 2465 would, in the absence of any
  other relevant rule changes, make that event impossible to
  satisfy in the future. However, if someone had already done so in
  the current round, it would still count.

  Unless specified otherwise, strings comparisons are
  case-insensitive and a string has/contains all of its substrings
  and partial words. For example, if a text contains the word
  "cramps" then it is also considered to contain "Amps"

  Each event is tagged with an estimated difficulty, which affects
  the relative probability that it gets drawn for a board: Very
  Easy (1/9x), Easy (1/3x), Medium (1x), Difficult (1/3x), Very
  Difficult (1/9x). Note that these are relative probabilities, not
  category weights. If there are 900 very difficult events and 100
  medium events, the final result will be about 50/50
