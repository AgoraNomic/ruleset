text: |
  Generalized auctions exist to give context to the form of other
  types of auctions. They cannot be held directly. Other auction
  methods that use this type of auction as a starting point can
  override attributes of generalized auctions except when it is
  explicitly stated that that attribute is not able to be
  overridden.

  1. INITIATION:
      * The auctioneer CAN begin an auction that e is authorized to
        by creating a public message (henceforth the "initiation
        message"), specifying the type of auction method that will
        be held, a list of lots that will be auctioned off, and the
        currency that the auction uses. Bidding is initally open.
      * Derivative auction methods cannot specify the exclusion of
        any information listed above from the initiation message of
        auctions using that method.
  2. BIDDING:
      * Players CAN place a bid on an open auction by creating a
        public message (henceforth a "bid message") specifying a
        number of the auction's currency as eir bid not equal to the
        bid of another player.
      * Players CAN withdraw from an open auction by announcement.
  3. TERMINATION:
      * Bidding is closed four days after either the beginning of
        the auction or after the most recent bid was placed,
        whichever is later. The auction ends at this time as well.
  4. AWARDING:
      * For each auction, there are a number of awardees equal to
        the number of lots. The Nth lot of an auction goes to the
        Nth awardee of that auction. If the identity of an awardee
        is undecidable, then that lot cannot be given away.
      * Auction methods specify how awardees are picked for auctions
        using that method.
      * Derivative auction methods should ensure that only players
        who have at least as much of that auction's currency as eir
        highest bid on that auction (hereafter "funded players") can
        be selected as awardees for auctions using that auction
        method.
      * The auctioneer of an auction SHALL after the ending of that
        auction create a public message (henceforth the
        "termination message") that contains a full history of bids
        on the auction and withdrawals from the auction. It should
        also clearly indicate each awardee and the lot e recieves.
  5. CLAIMING:
      * During the period from the end of the auction until 7 days
        after the publication of the termiation message, each
        awardee of that auction CAN transfer (or create in eir own
        possession if the item is new) the set of assets associated
        with the lot e won by paying a fee corresponding to eir
        winning bid.
