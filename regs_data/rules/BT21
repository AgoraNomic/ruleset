  A country can’t dislodge or support the dislodgment of one of its
  own units, even if that dislodgment is unexpected. An attack by a
  country on one of its own units doesn’t cut support. A convoyed
  Army doesn’t cut the support of a unit supporting an attack
  against one of the Fleets necessary for the Army to convoy.
