name: Guidelines to Referees for Compiling Weekly Reports
text: |
  Courtesy of the illustrious Publius Scribonius Scholasticus, when
  making eir weekly report on blot holdings, a Referee is ENCOURAGED
  to additionally include:

  1. A section tracking investigations resulting from a finger being
  pointed of which the Referee is the investigator, which have not
  been concluded at the time of the report’s publishing; e SHOULD
  provide the following fields for each entry:

      a. Name of the perp
      b. Name of the person who pointed eir finger
      d. Summary of the available findings at the time of the report

  The Referee is strongly DISCOURAGED from reporting on
  investigations of which e is not the investigator. At the time of
  the promulgation of this regulation, the only rule-defined
  circumstance in which the Referee is not the investigator is when
  the Referee is the perp. As such, eir reports on such
  investigations may be misleading and are at a high likelihood of
  violating rule 2471.

  2. A section tracking historical changes to the blots possessed by
  persons. If available, the time period tracked is RECOMMENDED to
  begin from approximately two years prior and end at the time of
  the report’s publishing. E SHOULD provide the following columns
  for this section:

      a. Name of person in whose possession the number of blots has
         changed
      b. Change in number of blots
      c. Date of change
      d. Reason of change
