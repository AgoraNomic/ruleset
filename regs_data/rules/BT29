  # Pre-Finale

  During the Pre-Finale, the Host and any Survivor CAN publish a Finale

  Host CAN, by announcement, veto a specified Finale Script. If a Finale
  Script has not been veto'd, and has support of either more than half of
  all Ghosts or more than half of all Contestants, then the Host CAN and
  SHALL apply it, causing it to become Effective.

  If at least one Finale Script is Effective and has been Effective for
  the previous 4 days, the Host CAN by announcement begin the Finale.

  While Effective, a Finale Script can authorize changes to the state
  defined under this regulation.

  # Finale

  Before or during the Finale, the Host CAN once by announcement set the
  Tiebreaking Hash to a specified SHA-256 hash of a document. The document
  must specify a single ranked order of all persons who were Survivors at
  the time it was submitted. The Host SHALL do this before the Finale and
  SHOULD NOT reveal the hashed document until it is required or a winner
  has been determined.

  During a Voting Phase, all Contestants CAN, by sending a message to the
  Host, vote on a specified Survivor.

  When the Finale begins, the Primary Voting Phase begins.

  When all Contestants have voted on a Voting Phase, or 7 days after the
  Voting Phase began:
  * First, the Voting Phase ends.
  * If a single Survivor has the most votes, the Host CAN by announcement
  and SHALL expel all other Survivors (causing them to cease to be Survivors).
  * Otherwise, if multiple Survivors are tied for the most votes:
    * If the completed phase is the Primary Voting Phase, the Host CAN by
  announcement and SHALL expel all Survivors not in the tie. After this,
  the Secondary Voting Phase begins.
    * Otherwise, the Host SHALL reveal the document used to compute the
  Tiebraking Hash, then the Host CAN by announcement and SHALL expel all
  Survivors except for the first Survivor in the order listed in the
  revealed document.
