Agora: |
  Welcome to the Agora ruleset! The rules of Agora are rather complex, any many
  of them are not particularly necessary to read as a new player. These
  annotations have been added to each section to help you get the gist of the
  rules so you can jump in and play.
Players: |
  To join the game, simply send a message to the main mailing list
  (agora-official) indicating that you wish to do so. You can leave the game
  in the same fashion; if you do so, you may not rejoin for 30 days.
Rules & Power: |
  Most of this section is some technical stuff that isn't particularly
  important when getting started. The most important part is that every rule
  has a power from 1 to 4; rules with higher power override rules with lower
  power, and rules with higher power require a larger majority to change.
Reusable Definitions: |
  This section defines a large number of terms that are used throughout the
  rules. References to these terms appear as links, and you can click on them
  to view the definitions as necessary.
Proposals: |
  Proposals allow you to propose changes to the rules. You may create a
  proposal by sending a message to agora-official with listing the proposal's
  title, its adoption index (generally, this should be the power of the highest
  rule changed by the proposal) and a description of how you want to change the
  rules (including the text of any new rules or text added to existing rules).
  You may then pend the proposal via one of the mechanisms listed in "How to
  Pend a Proposal." Once you do so, the Promotor will include it in their
  weekly email, and the players will vote on it.
Voting & Elections: |
  This section describes the technical process for a vote (described in the
  rules as an Agoran Decision). Most of it works like you expect; players
  cast their votes, then one week from the beginning of a vote the result
  is determined. The last rule in this section also describes when and how
  elections for officers occur.
Offices & Reporting: |
  Pretty much everything in the game is tracked by an officer; these officers
  send weekly or monthly emails to agora-official detailing the state of the
  game. There is a process known as deputisation that allows players to take
  the place of an officer who stops doing their job for whatever reason.
Rulekeeping: |
  This section details the format of the ruleset. Note that this web page is
  not officially part of the game, but is maintained by the Rulekeepor for
  convenience. The official rulesets are plain text documents linked at the
  top of the page.
Calls for Judgement: |
  The CFJ system is our "court," used for resolving disputes about the
  interpretation of the rules. If a dispute ever arises, you may "call a CFJ"
  on a statement such as "I currently have a pink ribbon" by sending a message
  to agora-business.
Punishment: |
  If you violate a rule, the Referee or another player may issue you a Green,
  Yellow, or Red Card depending on the severity of the crime. Green Cards bear
  no punishment, and are used for minor crimes. Yellow and Red Cards have
  punishments associated, and are used for major or repeated crimes.
Winning: |
  There are various mechanisms in the game that allow you to win the game. When
  you win, you become the Speaker (a figurehead role with little additional
  power), but the game continues. There are several methods of winning the game
  listed in this section, and a few listed in other sections as well. The
  methods in this section are as follows:

  * **Victory by Apathy**: You win if you state that you wish to win by apathy,
    and nobody stops you via a message to agora-business within four days.
  * **Victory Elections**: Twice a year, the Herald can start a Victory
    Election. The winner of the election wins the game.
  * **Trust Tokens**: A player may give another player a trust token via an
    email to agora-business. In addition, you recieve a trust token if a player
    decides to endorse you (state that they wish to vote however you do) in a
    vote. If you have a trust token from everybody, you win.
Awards: |
  There are a variety of actions that cause you to gain a colored ribbon. Once
  you have performed one of those actions, you or another player may "award"
  you the ribbon. If you have every ribbon, you win. This section also
  describes various "patent titles" that can be awarded to players for various
  things; patent titles generally have no effect on the game.
The Prime Minister: |
  The prime minister is a player with the right to issue certain Executive
  Orders, such as becoming the judge of a CFJ or giving a player a Card.
Obligations: |
  You are not allowed to break a pledge made in an email to agora-business
  or agora-official. There is also a system called Agencies that allows you
  to permit other players to perform actions on your behalf; you can ignore
  this until you are ready.
Holidays, Events & History: |
  Nothing in this section is of terrible significance. 
Organizations: |
  Organizations are a complex mechanic that you can ignore for now. They don't
  get used much these days, but you can create an Organization that can magage
  shinies and other assets according to a document called its Charter.
Estates: |
  Estates are a relatively minor game mechanic. They are auctioned off monthly,
  and you may use them to gain an extra vote. You can ignore them for now.
Shinies: |
  Shinies are the currency of Agora. They work pretty much how you'd expect;
  you can pay them to other people, etc. Upon first joining the game, you or
  someone else can award you a Welcome Package of 50 shinies. This section also
  describes Stamps; you can buy them or sell them from Agora for a price
  dependent on the state of the economy. You can use stamps as an investment,
  but they also provide a means of winning: you win if you have stamps
  originally purchased from Agora by 10 different people.
Festivals: |
  Players can start a festival, preventing players with fewer than a certain
  number of ribbons from participating in many aspects of the game. You don't
  need to pay much attention to this section unless someone starts a festival.
Miscelaneous: |
  There isn't anything of much importance in here. One important note is that
  you may not intentionally perform an action not permitted by the roles in
  order to trick others into believing it has actually occured.
