with the Rules, communicate their game Actions and/or results of
these actions via <a href="#Rule478">Fora</a> in order to play the game.  The game may
be won, but the game never ends.</p>

actions by players to cause arbitrary <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> changes to be made and/or
arbitrary proposals to be adopted within a four-week period.</p>

effect, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.If any other single change
to the gamestate would cause Agora to become ossified, or would cause

<p>The <a href="#Rule2139">Registrar</a> may change the publicity of a forum without

<p>A <a href="#Rule478">public</a> <a href="#Rule478">message</a> is a <a href="#Rule478">message</a> sent via a <a href="#Rule478">public</a> forum, or sent
to all players and containing a clear designation of intent to
be public.  A <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> can also designate that a part of one public
message is considered a <a href="#Rule478">public</a> <a href="#Rule478">message</a> in its own right. A
person &quot;publishes&quot; or &quot;announces&quot; something by sending a public
message.</p>

<p>Where the rules define an action that <a href="#Rule2152">CAN</a> be performed &quot;by
announcement&quot;, a <a href="#Rule869">person</a> performs that action by unambiguously
and clearly specifying the action and announcing that e performs
it.  Any action performed by sending a <a href="#Rule478">message</a> is performed at
the time date-stamped on that message. Actions in messages
(including sub-messages) are performed in the order they appear
in the message, unless otherwise specified.</p>

<li><p>Publishing Cantus Cygnei and Writs of FAGE as described in

by the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part

            <p>Most of this section is some technical stuff that isn&#39;t particularly
important when getting started. The most important part is that every rule
has a power from 1 to 4; rules with higher power override rules with lower

            <h4>Role and Attributes of Rules <span class="label label-default">2141</span>  <span class="label label-default">3</span></h4>
            
            <p>A <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> is a type of instrument with the capacity to govern the
game generally, and is always taking effect.  A rule&#39;s content
takes the form of a text, and is unlimited in scope.</p>

<p>Every <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> has <a href="#Rule1688">power</a> between 0.1 and 4.0 inclusive.  It is
not possible for a <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> to have a <a href="#Rule1688">power</a> outside this range.</p>

<p>Rules have ID numbers, to be assigned by the Rulekeepor.</p>

<p>Every <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> shall have a title to aid in identification.  If a
rule ever does not have a title, the <a href="#Rule1051">Rulekeepor</a> <a href="#Rule2152">SHALL</a> assign a
title to it <a href="#Rule478">by announcement</a> in a <a href="#Rule1023">timely</a> fashion.</p>

<p>For the purposes of rules governing modification of instruments,
the text, power, ID number, and title of a <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> are all
substantive aspects of the rule.  However, rules to the contrary
notwithstanding, the <a href="#Rule1051">Rulekeepor</a> <a href="#Rule2152">CAN</a> set <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> aspects as
described elsewhere in this rule.</p>

            <p>The <a href="#Rule1688">Power</a> of an entity is a non-negative rational number.  An
Instrument is an entity with positive Power.</p>

<p>The <a href="#Rule1688">Power</a> of an entity cannot be set or modified except as
stipulated by the Rules.  All entities have <a href="#Rule1688">Power</a> zero except
where specifically allowed by the rules.</p>

<p>Power less than one is called Ephemeral power, and an instrument
with a <a href="#Rule1688">power</a> less than one is an Ephemeral instrument.</p>

<p>A <a href="#Rule2141">Rule</a> that makes a change, action, or value secured (hereafter
the securing Rule) thereby makes it <a href="#Rule2152">IMPOSSIBLE</a> to perform that
change or action, or to set or modify that value, except as
allowed by an Instrument with <a href="#Rule1688">Power</a> greater than or equal to the
change&#39;s <a href="#Rule1688">Power</a> Threshold.  This Threshold defaults to the
securing Rule&#39;s Power, but <a href="#Rule2152">CAN</a> be lowered as allowed by that
Rule (including by the <a href="#Rule2141">Rule</a> itself).</p>

            <p>When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
takes precedence.  Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense,
past judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the
game.</p>

<p>Definitions and prescriptions in the rules are only to be
applied using direct, forward reasoning; in particular, an
absurdity that can be concluded from the assumption that a
statement about rule-defined concepts is false does not
constitute proof that it is true.  Definitions in lower-powered
Rules do not overrule common-sense interpretations or common
definitions of terms in higher-powered rules.</p>

<p>Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, any <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> change that
would (1) prevent a <a href="#Rule869">person</a> from initiating a formal process to
resolve matters of controversy, in the reasonable expectation
that the controversy will thereby be resolved; or (2) prevent a
person from causing formal reconsideration of any judicial
determination that e should be punished, is wholly void and

<p>No change to the Ruleset can occur that would cause a <a href="#Rule2141">Rule</a> to

instrument may specify a title for the new rule, which if
present shall prevail.  The ID number of the new <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> cannot
be specified by the enacting instrument; any attempt to so
specify is null and void.</p></li>
<li><p>repeal a rule.  When a <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> is repealed, it ceases to be a
rule, and the <a href="#Rule1051">Rulekeepor</a> need no longer maintain a record

recent <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> number may be reenacted with the same ID number
and the next change identifier.  If no text is specified,
the <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> is reenacted with the same text it had when it was
most recently repealed.  If the reenacting <a href="#Rule2350">proposal</a> provides
new text for the rule, the <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> must have materially the
same purpose as did the repealed version; otherwise, the

<p>A <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> change is any effect that falls into the above classes.
Rule changes always occur sequentially, never simultaneously.</p>

<p>Any ambiguity in the specification of a <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> change causes that
change to be void and without effect.  An inconsequential
variation in the quotation of an existing <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> does not
constitute ambiguity for the purposes of this rule, but any
other variation does.</p>

<p>A <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> change is wholly prevented from taking effect unless its
full text was published, along with an unambiguous and clear
specification of the method to be used for changing the rule, at
least 4 <a href="#Rule1023">days</a> and no more than 60 <a href="#Rule1023">days</a> before it would otherwise
take effect.</p>

<p>This <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> provides the only mechanism by which rules can be

            <p>A type of <a href="#Rule2162">switch</a> is a property that the rules define as a
switch, and specify the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The type(s) of entity possessing an instance of that switch.
No other entity possesses an instance of that switch.</p></li>
<li><p>One or more possible values for instances of that switch,
exactly one of which is designated as the default.  No other
values are possible for instances of that switch.</p></li>
<li><p>Optionally, exactly one <a href="#Rule1006">office</a> whose holder tracks instances
of that switch.  That officer&#39;s (weekly, if not specified
otherwise) <a href="#Rule2143">report</a> includes the value of each instance of that
<a href="#Rule2162">switch</a> whose value is not its default value; a public
document purporting to be this portion of that officer&#39;s
<a href="#Rule2143">report</a> is self-ratifying, and implies that other instances
are at their default value.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>At any given time, each instance of a <a href="#Rule2162">switch</a> has exactly one
possible value for that type of switch.  If an instance of a
switch comes to have a value, it ceases to have any other value.
If an instance of a <a href="#Rule2162">switch</a> would otherwise fail to have a
possible value, it comes to have its default value.</p>

<p>&quot;To flip an instance of a switch&quot; is to make it come to have a
given value.  &quot;To become X&quot; (where X is a possible value of
exactly one of the subject&#39;s switches) is to flip that <a href="#Rule2162">switch</a> to
X.</p>

<p>If an action or set of actions would cause the value of an
instance of a <a href="#Rule2162">switch</a> to become indeterminate, the instance
instead takes on its last determinate and possible value, if
any, otherwise it takes on its default value.</p>

<p>A natural <a href="#Rule2162">switch</a> is a <a href="#Rule2162">switch</a> with a default value of 0, unless
the rules explicitly specify a different default value.  If the
rules define an upper limit for the switch, then the possible
values are non-negative integers not greater than that limit,
otherwise the values are the non-negative integers.</p>

<p>A singleton <a href="#Rule2162">switch</a> is a <a href="#Rule2162">switch</a> for which Agora Nomic is the only
entity possessing an instance of that switch.</p>

<p>A boolean <a href="#Rule2162">switch</a> is a <a href="#Rule2162">switch</a> with values True and False. A
positive boolean <a href="#Rule2162">switch</a> has a default of True; a negative
boolean <a href="#Rule2162">switch</a> has a default of False.</p>

This time period is set when the requirement is created
(i.e. X <a href="#Rule1023">days</a> before the limit ends).  A requirement to
perform an action at an exact instant (e.g.  &quot;when X, Y
<a href="#Rule2152">SHALL</a> Z&quot;), but not &quot;in the same message&quot;, is instead
interpreted as a requirement to perform that action in a
<a href="#Rule1023">timely</a> fashion after that instant.</p></li>
<li><p>Agoran epochs:</p>

<ol>
<li>Agoran <a href="#Rule1023">days</a> begin at midnight UTC.</li>

April, July, and October begin.</li>
<li>Agoran years begin when the Agoran <a href="#Rule1023">month</a> of January
begins.</li>
<li>A <a href="#Rule1023">pivot</a> is either the instant at which Agora Nomic began
(June 30, 1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200) or an instant at
which at least one <a href="#Rule869">person</a> won the game.  When used as a
period of time, a &quot;Round&quot; (historical syn: &quot;game&quot;) is
the period of time between a <a href="#Rule1023">pivot</a> and the next pivot.</li>
</ol>

<p>These definitions do not apply to relative durations (e.g.
&quot;within &lt;number&gt; <a href="#Rule1023">days</a> after &lt;event&gt;&quot;).</p></li>
<li><p>If a restricted value, or the value of a conditional, or a
value otherwise required to determine the outcome of a
restricted action, <a href="#Rule2152">CANNOT</a> be reasonably determined (without
circularity or paradox) from information reasonably
available, or if it alternates instantaneously and
indefinitely between values, then the value is considered to
be Indeterminate, otherwise it is Determinate.</p></li>

is POSSIBLE for the principal to do so, taking into account any
prerequisites for the action. If the enabling <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> does not specify the
mechanism by which the agent may do so, then the agent <a href="#Rule2152">CAN</a> perform the
action in the same manner in which the principal <a href="#Rule2152">CAN</a> do so, with the
additional requirement that the agent must, in the <a href="#Rule478">message</a> in which the

            <p>An asset is an entity defined as such by the ruleset (hereafter its backing
document), and existing solely because its backing document defines its
existence.</p>

<p>Each asset has exactly one owner.If an asset would otherwise lack an
owner, it is owned by Agora.If an asset&#39;s backing document restricts
its ownership to a class of entities, then that asset <a href="#Rule2152">CANNOT</a> be
gained by or transferred to an entity outside that class, and is
destroyed if it is owned by an entity outside that class (except for
Agora, in which case any <a href="#Rule869">player</a> <a href="#Rule2152">CAN</a> transfer or destroy it without
objection). The restrictions in the previous sentence are subject to
modification by its backing document.</p>

<p>Unless modified by an asset&#39;s backing document, ownership of an asset is
restricted to Agora, persons, and organizations.</p>

<p>An organization&#39;s charter <a href="#Rule2152">CAN</a> specify whether or not that <a href="#Rule2459">organization</a> is
willing receive assets or a class of assets. Generally, an <a href="#Rule2459">organization</a> CANNOT
be given assets its charter states that it is unwilling to receive. The
previous provisions of this paragraph do not apply to an asset if the
organization is required to provide that asset in order to continue existing.</p>

<p>The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity (if any)
defined as such by, and bound by, its backing document.  That
entity&#39;s <a href="#Rule2143">report</a> includes a list of all instances of that class
and their owners.  This portion of that entity&#39;s <a href="#Rule2143">report</a> is
self-ratifying.</p>

<p>An asset generally <a href="#Rule2152">CAN</a> be destroyed by its owner by
announcement, subject to modification by its backing document. An
indestructible asset is one defined as such by it backing document, and CANNOT
be destroyed except by a <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> specifically addressing the destruction of
indestructible assets or that asset in particular; any other asset is
destructible. In circumstances where another asset would be
destroyed, an indestructible asset is generally transferred to Agora, subject
to modification by its backing document and the intervention of other rules.</p>

<p>To &quot;lose&quot; an asset is to have it destroyed from one&#39;s
possession; to &quot;revoke&quot; an asset from an entity is to destroy it
from that entity&#39;s possession.</p>

<p>An asset generally <a href="#Rule2152">CAN</a> be transferred (syn. payed, given) by its owner to
another entity by announcement, subject to modification by its backing
document.  A fixed asset is one defined as such by its backing
document, and <a href="#Rule2152">CANNOT</a> be transferred; any other asset is liquid.</p>

<p>When a <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> indicates transfering an amount that is not a natural number,
the specified amount is rounded up to the nearest natural number.</p>

<p>A currency is a class of asset defined as such by its backing document.
Instances of a currency with the same owner are fungible.</p>

<p>The &quot;x <a href="#Rule2483">balance</a> of an entity&quot;, where x is a currency, is the number of x that
entity possesses. If a rule, proposal, or other competent authority attempts
to increase or decrease the <a href="#Rule2483">balance</a> of an entity without specifying a source
or destination, then the currency is created or destroyed.</p>

<p>When a <a href="#Rule869">player</a> causes one or more balances to change, e is ENCOURAGED
to specify the resulting balance(s). Players <a href="#Rule2152">SHOULD</a> NOT specify
inaccurate balances.</p>

<p>Where it resolves ambiguity, the asset or currency being referred to is the
currency designated as &quot;Agora&#39;s official currency&quot;, if there is one.</p>

<p>Amendments to a backing document shall not be construed to alter, transfer,
destroy, or otherwise effect any assets defined by that document, unless
that is their clear intent.</p>

<p>Assets are always public. [To provide for private contract based assets later]</p>

            <p>A Regulation is an instrument defined as such by this rule. A regulation
allows an officer (known as the Promulgator) to exercise <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> defined powers.
A regulation is in effect continuously from the time of its creation to the
time of either its revocation or the repeal of the <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> that allowed for its
creation. When recommending a regulation, its Promulgator must specify by
number the rule(s) upon which it is based (the parent rules), the list of
which becomes an integral part of the regulation. The list of rules can
generally be modified by the Promulgator according to the procedure for text
changes.</p>

<p>A regulation must be authorized by at least one <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> in order for it to exist.
A regulation has effect on the game (only) insofar as the <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> or rules that
authorized it permit it to have effect, and a regulation generally inherits
the <a href="#Rule1688">power</a> of its least powerful parent rule, unless its Promulgator defines
a lower power. If reasonably possible, a regulation should be
interpreted so as to defer to other rules. The procedure for resolving
conflict between regulations is the same as it is for rules.</p>

<p>Regulations are generally issued according to the following procedures,
and they can be repealed by the announcement of their Promulgator. Alternate
procedures may be used if provided for by all of the regulations&#39;s parent
rules. If one parent <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> specifies procedures that are more stringent than
those that the other(s) specifies, those apply. Creating, modifying, revoking,
or allowing for a regulation is secured at <a href="#Rule1688">power</a> 1.</p>

<p>A regulation (or set of regulations), authorized by another rule, may
generally be enacted or modified by its promulgator without 2 objections,
or with Agoran consent. A <a href="#Rule2124">notice</a> pursuant to the previous sentence is
known as a &quot;recommendation&quot;, and the regulation(s) are said to be
&quot;recommended&quot; to Agora.</p>

regulations <a href="#Rule2152">SHOULD</a> be assigned the next successive natural number. Title 0 of

have no binding effect, and <a href="#Rule2152">SHALL</a> clearly be marked by the Regkeepor.</p>

<p>Each regulation <a href="#Rule2152">SHALL</a> be assigned an ID number by the Regkeepor, consisting
of a string of the characters [0-9] and separator characters. The Regkeepor
SHOULD establish some way of keeping track of the version of a regulations.
The Regkeepor <a href="#Rule2152">MAY</a> also, at eir discretion, create ways of marking special
types of Regulation (even in violation of the previous restrictions of this
paragraph), mark sections or titles as reserved for future use, and
make such other discussions of arrangement, annotation, and marking as are
necessary and proper in the execution of eir duties.</p>

<p>The Regkeepor <a href="#Rule2152">SHOULD</a> remember that the purpose of the ACORN is to make the

<p>Creating a <a href="#Rule2350">proposal</a> adds it to the <a href="#Rule2350">Proposal</a> Pool.  Once a

<p>Determining whether to adopt a <a href="#Rule2350">proposal</a> is an Agoran decision.
For this decision, the vote collector is the Assessor, the
adoption index is initially the adoption index of the proposal,
or 1.0 if the <a href="#Rule2350">proposal</a> does not have one, and the text, author,
and coauthors of the <a href="#Rule2350">proposal</a> are essential parameters. 
Initiating such a <a href="#Rule693">decision</a> is known as distribution, and removes
the <a href="#Rule2350">proposal</a> from the <a href="#Rule2350">Proposal</a> Pool.</p>

<p>The <a href="#Rule1607">Promotor</a> <a href="#Rule2152">CAN</a> distribute a <a href="#Rule2350">proposal</a> which is in the Proposal

<p>In a given Agoran week, the <a href="#Rule1607">Promotor</a> SHALL, as part of eir

<ol>
<li><p>AI-majority: the valid votes are FOR and AGAINST. Let F be
the total strength of all valid ballots cast FOR a decision,
A be the same for AGAINST, and AI be the adoption index of
the decision. The outcome is ADOPTED if F/A &gt;= AI and F/A &gt;
1 (or F&gt;0 and A=0), otherwise REJECTED.</p></li>
<li><p>Instant runoff: the valid votes are ordered lists of
options, and the outcome is whichever option wins according
to the standard definition of instant runoff. For this
purpose, a ballot of strength N is treated as if it were N
distinct ballots expressing the same preferences. In case
multiple valid options tie for the lowest number of votes at
any stage, the vote collector <a href="#Rule2152">CAN</a> and must, in the
announcement of the decision&#39;s resolution, select one such
option to eliminate; if, for M &gt; 1, all eir possible choices
in the next M stages would result in the same set of options
being eliminated, e need not specify the order of
elimination.</p></li>
<li><p>First-past-the-post (default): the valid votes are the
options, and the outcome is whichever option received the
highest total strength of valid ballots. In case of a tie,
the vote collector <a href="#Rule2152">CAN</a> and must, in the announcement of the
decision&#39;s resolution, select one of the leaders as the
outcome.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The previous notwithstanding:</p>

<ul>
<li>If there is more than one option, and the number of valid
ballots is less than the <a href="#Rule879">quorum</a> of that decision, the outcome
is instead FAILED QUORUM.</li>
<li>PRESENT is always a valid vote, with no effect on the outcome
except counting towards quorum.</li>
<li>If there are no valid options, the outcome is null.</li>
</ul>

<p>The outcome of a <a href="#Rule693">decision</a> is determined when it is resolved, and
cannot change thereafter.</p>

            <p>Each Agoran <a href="#Rule693">Decision</a> has a quorum. This is a number set when the
decision is created, and thereafter cannot be changed. When a
person initiates an Agoran Decision, that <a href="#Rule869">person</a> <a href="#Rule2152">SHALL</a> state the
quorum of that decision. However, incorrectly stating the quorum
of a <a href="#Rule693">decision</a> does not invalidate the initiation, nor does it

<p>The <a href="#Rule879">quorum</a> that an Agoran <a href="#Rule693">Decision</a> gains as it is created can be
defined by other rules of <a href="#Rule1688">power</a> 2 or greater. If no other rule
defines the <a href="#Rule879">quorum</a> of an Agoran Decision, the <a href="#Rule879">quorum</a> for that
decision is equal to the number of players who voted on the
Agoran <a href="#Rule693">Decision</a> to adopt a <a href="#Rule2350">proposal</a> that had been most recently
resolved at the time of that decision&#39;s initiation, minus 2.</p>

<p>As an exception to the previous paragraph, the <a href="#Rule879">quorum</a> of an
Agoran <a href="#Rule693">Decision</a> can never be less than 2. If the rules would
attempt to set the <a href="#Rule879">quorum</a> of an Agoran <a href="#Rule693">Decision</a> to less than 2,
it is set to 2 instead.</p>

<p>When multiple rules set or modify an entity&#39;s <a href="#Rule2422">voting strength</a> on

<pre><code>* FALSE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
  logically false

* TRUE, appropriate if the statement was factually and logically
  true

* IRRELEVANT, appropriate if the veracity of the statement is
  not relevant to the game or is an overly hypothetical
  extrapolation of the game or its rules to conditions that
  don&#39;t actually exist, or if it can be trivially determined
  from the outcome of another (possibly still undecided)
  judicial case that was not itself judged IRRELEVANT

* INSUFFICIENT, appropriate if the statement does not come with
  supporting arguments or evidence, and the judge feels as if an
  undue burden is being placed on em by the lack of arguments and
  evidence.  A [CFJ](#Rule991) judged as INSUFFICIENT [CAN](#Rule2152) and [SHOULD](#Rule2152) be
  submitted again with sufficient arguments/evidence.

* DISMISS, appropriate if the statement is malformed, undecidable,
  if insufficient information exists to make a judgement with
  reasonable effort, or the statement is otherwise not able to be
  answered with another valid judgement.

            <p>There are various mechanisms in the game that allow you to win the game. When
you win, you become the Speaker (a figurehead role with little additional
power), but the game continues. There are several methods of winning the game
listed in this section, and a few listed in other sections as well. The
methods in this section are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Victory by Apathy</strong>: You win if you state that you wish to win by apathy,
and nobody stops you via a message to agora-business within four days.</li>
<li><strong>Victory Elections</strong>: Twice a year, the Herald can start a Victory
Election. The winner of the election wins the game.</li>
<li><strong>Trust Tokens</strong>: A player may give another player a trust token via an
email to agora-business. In addition, you recieve a trust token if a player
decides to endorse you (state that they wish to vote however you do) in a
vote. If you have a trust token from everybody, you win.</li>

<p>Ribbon Ownership is a <a href="#Rule869">person</a> switch, tracked by the Tailor in

types of Ribbon, defaulting to the empty set.</p>

<p>To &quot;award a <a href="#Rule869">person</a> a &lt;Ribbon type&gt;&quot; is to add that type of

&lt;Ribbon type&gt;&quot; if that type of <a href="#Rule2438">Ribbon</a> is an element of eir

<p>While a <a href="#Rule869">person</a> qualifies for a type of Ribbon, any <a href="#Rule869">player</a> can

<p>While a <a href="#Rule869">person</a> owns all types of Ribbon, that <a href="#Rule869">person</a> can Raise a

That person&#39;s <a href="#Rule2438">Ribbon</a> Ownership becomes the empty set.</p>

<p>The types of Ribbon, and the methods of obtaining them, are as
follows:</p>

<p>Red (R): When a <a href="#Rule2350">proposal</a> is adopted and changes at least one
rule with <a href="#Rule1688">Power</a> &gt;= 3, its proposer earns a Red Ribbon.</p>

<p>Orange (O): When a <a href="#Rule2350">proposal</a> is adopted via an Agoran <a href="#Rule693">Decision</a> on
which no valid votes were AGAINST, its proposer earns an Orange
Ribbon.</p>

<p>Green (G): While a <a href="#Rule869">person</a> has held an elected office
continuously for 30 days, and has not failed to perform any
duties of that <a href="#Rule1006">office</a> within the appropriate time limits during
those 30 days, that <a href="#Rule869">person</a> qualifies for a Green Ribbon.</p>

<p>Cyan (C): When a <a href="#Rule869">person</a> deputises for an office, that person
earns a Cyan Ribbon.</p>

<p>Blue (B): When a <a href="#Rule869">person</a> assigns a judgement to a CFJ, and has
never violated a time limit to assign a judgement to that CFJ,
that <a href="#Rule869">person</a> earns a Blue Ribbon.</p>

<p>Magenta (M): During Agora&#39;s Birthday, each <a href="#Rule869">person</a> who has
publicly acknowledged the fact qualifies for a Magenta Ribbon.</p>

<p>Ultraviolet (U): When a <a href="#Rule869">person</a> is awarded the <a href="#Rule649">Patent</a> Title
Champion, that <a href="#Rule869">person</a> earns an Ultraviolet Ribbon.</p>

<p>Violet (V): When a <a href="#Rule869">person</a> is awarded a <a href="#Rule649">Patent</a> Title other than
Champion or a degree, that <a href="#Rule869">person</a> earns a Violet Ribbon.</p>

<p>Indigo (I): When a <a href="#Rule869">person</a> is awarded a degree, that <a href="#Rule869">person</a> earns
an Indigo Ribbon.</p>

<p>Platinum (P): The <a href="#Rule103">Speaker</a> qualifies for a Platinum Ribbon.</p>

<p>Lime (L): A <a href="#Rule869">person</a> qualifies for a Lime <a href="#Rule2438">Ribbon</a> if three or more
proposals adopted in the preceding 7 <a href="#Rule1023">days</a> had that <a href="#Rule869">person</a> as a
coauthor.</p>

<p>White (W): A <a href="#Rule869">player</a> qualifies for a White <a href="#Rule2438">Ribbon</a> if e has never
previously owned a White <a href="#Rule2438">Ribbon</a> (including under previous
rulesets). A <a href="#Rule869">player</a> who has been registered for at least 30 days

(including under a previous ruleset) <a href="#Rule2152">CAN</a> award a White <a href="#Rule2438">Ribbon</a> to

Black Ribbons.</p>

<p>Gray (A): The Tailor <a href="#Rule2152">CAN</a> award a Gray <a href="#Rule2438">Ribbon</a> by announcement,
unless e has done so earlier in the month. E is <a href="#Rule2152">ENCOURAGED</a> to
award such a <a href="#Rule2438">Ribbon</a> in the same <a href="#Rule478">message</a> in which e publishes eir

<p>Transparent (T): A <a href="#Rule869">person</a> qualifies for a Transparent Ribbon
while the number of other types of <a href="#Rule2438">Ribbon</a> that that person

            <p>An Agency is a document empowering persons to act on <a href="#Rule2466">behalf</a> of another
player. A <a href="#Rule869">player</a> <a href="#Rule2152">MAY</a> establish an Agency With 24 hours Notice, and thereby
become its Director, by specifying the properties of the new Agency,
provided e has not established any other Agency that day:</p>

<ol>
<li>A title, which must be exactly three words, not counting
 conjunctions, articles or prepositions.</li>
<li>A non-empty list of persons other than the Director (the Agents).</li>
<li>A description of a set of actions (the Powers).</li>
</ol>

<p>An Agency&#39;s Director may amend its properties or revoke it with 24 hours
Notice. For greater certainty, an announced intent to create an Agency or
amend an Agency&#39;s powers is <a href="#Rule2152">INEFFECTIVE</a> unless it explicitly specifies the
new values of the properties being created or amended.</p>

<p>The Powers of an Agency must be stated as actions, although they may may
be conditional on date, time, game state, or other preconditions. If
condition(s) are specified as necessary for a <a href="#Rule1688">power</a> to be used, it is
limited; otherwise, it is unlimited. If it attempts to specify a <a href="#Rule1688">power</a> in
a manner that is unclear, ambiguous, circular, inconsistent, paradoxical,
or that depends on information that is impossible or unreasonably
difficult to determine, then the specification of that <a href="#Rule1688">power</a> is invalid,
and it <a href="#Rule2152">CANNOT</a> be used.</p>

<p>An Agency, once created, <a href="#Rule2152">SHOULD</a> be referred to by the acronym formed from
its title with conjunctions, articles, and prepositions removed. The
acronym of an agency must be unique and any attempt to create or amend an
Agency such that two Agencies would have the same acronym is INEFFECTIVE.</p>

<p>The Agents of an Agency may perform the Actions described in the Powers of
the Agency on <a href="#Rule2466">behalf</a> of the Agency&#39;s Director.</p>

            <p>WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world&#39;s only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;</p>

<p>And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial
Rulesets of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets
of Nomic World and other nomics,</p>

<p>And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June 30,
1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a <a href="#Rule478">message</a> sent by FIRST SPEAKER
Michael Norrish, which read, in part,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think we
may as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules are
invited. In accordance with the rules, these will be
published, numbered and distributed by me at my earliest
convenience.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic,
known unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was played
on, until its Players, much later, gave it its OFFICIAL NAME of
Agora,</p>

<p>And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest,
and most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the hard
work and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent advice of
Agoraphobes,</p>

<p>And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora&#39;s
founding,</p>

<p>BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora&#39;s Birthday is defined to be
the entire <a href="#Rule1023">day</a> of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year.</p>

            <p>An <a href="#Rule2459">Organization</a> is a type of entity. The following changes are
secured: creating, modifying, or destroying an Organization; and
causing an entity to become an <a href="#Rule2459">Organization</a> or cease to be an
Organization.</p>

<p>The Income Cap is 100.</p>

<p>Budget is a <a href="#Rule2162">switch</a> belonging to (Organization, player) pairs
(i.e. there is one instance of the <a href="#Rule2162">switch</a> for each combination
of an <a href="#Rule2459">Organization</a> and a player), tracked by the Secretary,
whose legal values are integers from 0 to the Income Cap
inclusive, defaulting to 0. An Organization&#39;s Income is the
total value of all Budget switches for pairs that include that
Organization. A player&#39;s Expenditure is the total value of all
Budget switches for pairs that include that player. Changes to
Budget are secured.</p>

consisting of that <a href="#Rule2459">Organization</a> and that <a href="#Rule869">player</a> has a nonzero
Budget.</p>

<p>It is IMPOSSIBLE, by any means, for a <a href="#Rule869">player</a> to become a member
of an Organization, or for an <a href="#Rule2459">organization</a> to be created with a
player as a member, without that player&#39;s explicit, willful
consent. This <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> takes precedence over any <a href="#Rule2141">rule</a> that might
make such a change possible.</p>

<p>A member of an <a href="#Rule2459">Organization</a> <a href="#Rule2152">CAN</a> perform any action the rules authorize that
Organization to perform, if the Organization&#39;s charter states that doing so
is Appropriate.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the above, a <a href="#Rule869">player</a> <a href="#Rule2152">CANNOT</a> create more than one

the appropriateness of amendments to that Organization.</p>

amendment to its Organization, or if it attempts to specify the
appropriateness of such an amendment but in a way that is

you can pay them to other people, etc. Upon first joining the game, you or
someone else can award you a Welcome Package of 50 shinies. This section also
describes Stamps; you can buy them or sell them from Agora for a price
dependent on the state of the economy. You can use stamps as an investment,
but they also provide a means of winning: you win if you have stamps
originally purchased from Agora by 10 different people.</p>

Without 3 Objections. By doing so e promulgates those regulations as a
