    <h1>The Agoran Rulesets</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome. If you are trying to access the ruleset of Agora Nomic,
      you've come to the right place. This website is maintained by
      Trigon, the current Rulekeepor of Agora Nomic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Agoran Rulesets come in two flavors: The Short Logical
      Ruleset (SLR) and the Full Logical Ruleset (FLR).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<a href="slr.txt">The Short Logical Ruleset</a> contains the
	full text of all currently enacted rules, organized into
	categories. If you are new to Agora, this is the most
	accessible version.
      </li>
      <li>
	<a href="flr.txt">The Full Logical Ruleset</a> contains the
	same rules as the SLR in the same order, along with a list of
	changes that rule has gone through as well as some other
	notable historical annotations.
      </li>
    </ul>
