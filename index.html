    <h1>The Agoran Rulesets</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome. If you are trying to access the ruleset of Agora Nomic,
      you've come to the right place. This website is maintained by
      Trigon, the current Rulekeepor of Agora Nomic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Agoran Rulesets come in two flavors: The Short Logical Ruleset
      (SLR) and the Full Logical Ruleset (FLR).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="slr.txt">The Short Logical Ruleset</a> contains the
        full text of all currently enacted rules, organized into
        categories. If you are new to Agora, this is the most
        accessible version.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="flr-fresh.txt">The Full Logical Ruleset</a> contains
	the same rules as the SLR in the same order, along with a list
	of changes that rule has gone through as well as some other
        notable historical annotations.
	<b>
	  Note that the one linked above is usually going to be
	  unofficial and updated to include the most recent changes. The
	  most recent <i>published</i> FLR is found
	  <a href="flr.txt">here</a>.
	</b>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Additionally, others have made software to track the ruleset.
      Here's a list of links to those.
      <b>Warning: these all navigate off-site.</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://agora-ruleset.gaelan.me">Gaelan's ruleset viewer</a>
        <a href="http://github.com/AgoraNomic/ruleset-viewer">(source)</a>
        displays the SLR in HTML format with a table of contents. This
	website is generated from current ruleset data like the textual
	rulesets linked above.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://github.com/AgoraNomic/ruleset-old">Gaelan's old ruleset code</a>
        does the same thing as the code I use to generate the
        rulesets, except it was written in Ruby.
      </li>
